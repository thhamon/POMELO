Interaction potential between cranberry juice and warfarin .
The interaction potential between warfarin and cranberry juice is discussed .
Reports from the United Kingdom have raised concern over the interaction potential between cranberry juice and warfarin .
Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed oral medication for anticoagulation therapy .
Cranberry juice is a flavonoid , which has been shown to induce , inhibit , or act as a substrate for the biosynthesis of several cytochrome P-450 ( CYP ) isoenzymes .
Specifically , cranberry juice may inhibit the activity of CYP2C9 , the primary isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of S-warfarin .
A search of the medical literature identified three peer-reviewed case reports and two peer-reviewed , prospective , randomized , placebo-controlled clinical trials using metabolic surrogates of warfarin ( flurbiprofen and cyclosporine ) that described possible interactions between cranberry juice and warfarin .
Two case reports suggested that cranberry juice increased the International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) of patients taking warfarin , but neither clearly identified cranberry juice as the sole cause of INR elevation .
One case report appeared to show a correlation between the effects of cranberry juice and warfarin metabolism .
Both clinical trials indicated the lack of an interaction between cranberry juice and CYP isoenzymes 2C9 and 3A , both of which are necessary in warfarin metabolism .
More studies are required to determine the potential interaction between cranberry juice and warfarin .
The available data do not seem to show a clinically relevant interaction between cranberry juice and warfarin ; however , patients taking warfarin with cranberry juice should be cautioned about the potential interaction and monitored closely for INR changes and signs and symptoms of bleeding .
