Important drug-nutrient interactions .
Drugs have the potential to interact with nutrients potentially leading to reduced therapeutic efficacy of the drug , nutritional risk or increased adverse effects of the drug .
Despite significant interest in such interactions going back to over more than 40 years , the occurrence and clinical significance of many drug-nutrient interactions remains unclear .
However , interactions involving drugs with a narrow therapeutic margin such as theophylline and digoxin and those that require careful blood monitoring such as warfarin are likely to be those of clinical significance .
Drugs can affect nutrition as a result of changes in appetite and taste as well as having an influence on absorption or metabolism of nutrients .
Moreover , foods and supplements can also interact with drugs , of which grapefruit juice and St John's wort are key examples .
Significant numbers of people take both supplements and medication and are potentially at risk from interactions .
Professionals , such as pharmacists , dietitians , nurses and doctors , responsible for the care of patients should therefore check whether supplements are being taken , while for researchers this is an area worthy of significant further study , particularly in the context of increasingly complex drug regimens and the plethora of new drugs .
