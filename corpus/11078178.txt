Effects of isradipine or enalapril on blood pressure in salt- salt-sensitive hypertensives during low and high dietary salt intake .
MIST II Trial Investigators .
This large multicenter study , tested the antihypertensive effects of isradipine , a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and enalapril , an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor , in salt- salt-sensitive hypertensive patients under low and high salt intake diets .
After a 3-week ( weeks -9 to -6 ) of ad lib salt diet , those patients who had a sitting diastolic blood pressure ( SDBP ) of sentsup or =95 but sentinf or =115 mm Hg qualified to enter a 3-week ( weeks -6 to -3 ) placebo run-in low salt diet ( 50 to 80 mmol Na+  day ) .
Then high salt ( 200 to 250 mmol Na+  day ) was added to the placebo treatment for 3 weeks ( weeks -3 to 0 ) .
Those patients who demonstrated an increase in SDBP sentsup or =5 mm Hg from the low to high salt diet were considered salt sensitive and were randomized into a 4-week ( weeks 0 to 4 ) double-blind treatment period of either isradipine 2.5 to 10 mg twice a day , enalapril 2.5 to 20 mg twice a day , or placebo .
Then they entered a 3-week ( weeks 4 to 7 ) placebo washout phase of low salt diet ( 50 to 80 mmol Na+  day ) .
After week 7 and while the low salt diet was continued the patients were restarted on their double-blind treatment for 4 more weeks ( weeks 7 to 11 ) and the study was completed .
Of 1 , 916 patients screened , 464 were randomized into the double-blind treatment phase and 397 completed the study .
Both isradipine and enalapril decreased the sitting systolic blood pressure ( SSBP ) and SDBP during the high salt diet , to a similar degree , whereas enalapril caused a greater reduction in SSBP and SDBP than isradipine during the low salt diet ( 11.3 +  - 1.2  7.7 +  - 0.7 mm Hg v 7.7 +  - 0.9  4.8 +  - 0.6 mm Hg , mean +  - SEM , respectively , P sentinf .

Within drugs , the effect of isradipine on blood pressure ( BP ) was higher during the high than the low salt diet ( 14.9 +  - 1.5 v 7.6 +  - 1.3 mm Hg for SSBP and 10.1 +  - 0.6 v 4.8 +  - 0.9 mm Hg for SDBP , P sentinf .

Because salt restriction lowered both SSBP and SDBP , the lowest BP achieved with both drugs were during the salt restriction phase .
