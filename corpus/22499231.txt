Impact of six fruits- -banana , guava , mangosteen , pineapple , ripe mango and ripe papaya papaya- -on murine hepatic cytochrome P450 activities .
The effects of six Thai fruits , namely banana , guava , mangosteen , pineapple , ripe mango and ripe papaya , on cytochrome P450 ( P450 ) activities were investigated .
The median inhibitory concentrations ( IC ( 50 ) ) of each of the fruit juices on CYP1A1 , CYP1A2 , CYP2E1 and CYP3A11 activities were determined .
Pineapple juice showed the strongest inhibitory effect against all the evaluated P450 isozyme activities in mouse hepatic microsomes , followed by mangosteen , guava , ripe mango , ripe papaya and banana .
The study was further performed in male ICR mice given pineapple juice intragastrically at doses of 10 , 20 and 40 mg kg ( -1 ) per day for 7 or 28 days .
In a concentration-dependent fashion , the pineapple juice raised ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase , aniline hydroxylase and erythromycin N-demethylase activities , which are marker enzymatic reactions responsible for CYP1A1 , CYP2E1 and CYP3A11 , respectively .
The effect of pineapple juice on the expression of CYP1A1 , CYP2E1 and CYP3A11 mRNAs corresponded to their enzymatic activities .
However , the pineapple juice significantly decreased methoxyresorufin O-demethylase activity .
These observations supported that the six Thai fruits were a feasible cause of food-drug interaction or adverse drug effects owing to their potential to modify several essential P450 activities .
Individuals consuming large quantities of pineapple for long periods of time should be cautioned of these potential adverse effects .
