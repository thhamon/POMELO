Ziprasidone for psychotic disorders disorders: a meta-analysis and systematic review of the relationship between pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , and clinical profile .
Among atypical antipsychotics , ziprasidone exhibits a unique clinical profile .
However , prescription rates for this medication remain among the lowest of all atypical antipsychotics .
The present meta-analysis examined premature study discontinuation ( PSD ) and dose-response associated with ziprasidone .
Furthermore , a systematic review of the clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and tolerability of ziprasidone was conducted to explain the meta-analytic findings .
A systematic search was performed in the electronic databases PubMed and EMBASE using the key words ziprasidone , randomized , positron emission tomography , pharmacokinetic , and tolerability .
This search looked for open-label or blinded studies of oral ziprasidone use in patients with psychoses ( schizophrenia- schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and  or bipolar mania ) published between January 1 , 1992 , and February 1 , 2011. .
Comparisons with antipsychotics for which there were sentinf3 studies in total were excluded .
PSD ( all causes ) was used as a measure of overall effectiveness .
Thirty-one studies were included in the final analysis .
The rates of PSD were significantly higher with ziprasidone compared with olanzapine ( inefficacy and all causes , P sentinf 0.001 ) and risperidone ( all causes , P = 0.004 ) .
In contrast , the rates of PSD due to inefficacy and adverse events were significantly lower with ziprasidone compared with quetiapine ( P = 0.03 ) and haloperidol ( P = 0.03 ) , respectively .
On dose-response analysis , the rate of all-cause PSD was significantly lower with combined 120-160 mg  d compared with placebo ( P = 0.001 ) .
Low levels of hyperprolactinemia and weight gain  metabolic adverse events , and moderate extrapyramidal symptoms and corrected QT-interval prolongation were reported with ziprasidone use .
Ziprasidone exposure was increased when the medication was administered with food , irrespective of fat content .
Ziprasidone 120-160 mg  d was correlated with 60% to 80% occupancy in studies of D ( 2 ) binding with the administration of multiple doses .
However , the same occupancy was achieved with single-dose administration at much lower doses ( 20-60 mg  d ) .
The findings from this meta-analysis and review suggest that ziprasidone 120-160 mg  d is a less effective treatment for psychotic disorders compared with olanzapine and risperidone , but that the low levels of hyperprolactinemia and weight gain  metabolic adverse events associated with ziprasidone may make it a useful option in patients in whom antipsychotics are poorly tolerated for these reasons .
