Assessment of nutraceuticals and food supplements .
It is now possible to define food supplements on the basis of their preclinical or clinical action .
Nutraceuticals and food supplements when used as drugs to prevent or treat clinical conditions could be defined as Pre-drugs ( Preventive drugs or pre-clinical drugs ) .
Nutraceuticals , when used with the aim to limit the continuous use of patented drugs , theoretically more dangerous , more expensive and causing more interactions could be defined as Substitutive-low-risk ( SLR ) -drugs.For these natural products the real ground of evaluation is the patient , or the subject at risk , possibly , the borderline patient .
In this supplement , our research group and network present some of our recent research and innovations particularly focusing on 'natural compounds' of very high preventive and clinical potentials .
The combination of so many experts from different medical fields makes this interaction very interesting and promising .
More studies and more applications for nutraceuticals and food supplements are coming .
