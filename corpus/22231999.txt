Cranberry and warfarin interaction interaction: a case report and review of the literature .
This case reports on a patient whose International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) increased after ingestion of cranberry sauce while stabilized on warfarin .
It is followed by a review of the published literature on the potential interaction between the two.An 85-year-old woman on chronic warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation experienced INR elevations of two- to three-fold after two separate ingestions of cranberry sauce .
In each case , her INR values decreased after withholding three to four doses and resuming a similar maintenance dose of warfarin .
Although the majority of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies did not find a significant interaction between cranberry and warfarin , several case reports indicate that cranberry products may increase INR values in patients on warfarin .
Practitioners should consider cranberry usage as a potential contributor in the evaluation of supratherapeutic INR values in patients on warfarin .
