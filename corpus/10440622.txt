Effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of sparfloxacin .
Sparfloxacin , a fluoroquinolone with a broad antimicrobial spectrum and long elimination half-life , is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adult patients .
The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of skim milk and a high-fat breakfast without milk on the single-dose pharmacokinetic characteristics of this antibiotic .
The pharmacokinetics of a single 200-mg dose of sparfloxacin were assessed in a 3-way crossover study that included 23 healthy male volunteers who had fasted , had ingested 240 mL of skim milk , or had consumed a standard high-fat breakfast .
The subjects' mean age and weight were 26.5 years and 73.2 kg , respectively ; 17 were white , 5 Hispanic , and 1 black .
Neither skim milk nor the high-fat breakfast had a statistically significant effect on sparfloxacin absorption , as reflected in the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ) .
Ninety percent confidence limits for logarithmically transformed AUC from time zero to infinity and Cmax were within the 80% to 125% range , demonstrating that the rate and extent of sparfloxacin absorption with skim milk or a high-fat breakfast were not different from those under fasted conditions .
As indicated by an increase in the time to Cmax from 3.6 to 5.4 hours , the high-fat breakfast slightly delayed the onset of sparfloxacin absorption .
Skim milk and the high-fat breakfast did not significantly affect the elimination kinetics of sparfloxacin .
Sparfloxacin was well tolerated in all 3 treatment groups .
Despite the apparent delay in the onset of absorption , the bioavailability of sparfloxacin in the healthy male subjects in this study population was not affected by concomitant administration with skim milk or a high-fat meal .
Accordingly , the results suggest that sparfloxacin can be administered without regard to the ingestion of milk or meals .
