Drug-nutrient interactions in enteral feeding: a primary care focus .
Drug and nutrient interactions are complex and can take many forms , including malabsorption of either the drug or the nutrient component .
Some drugs can stimulate or suppress appetite , whereas others can cause nausea and vomiting resulting in inadequate nutritional intake .
Absorption of drugs is a complex process that can be affected by the physical characteristics of the gastrointestinal tract ( GIT ) as well .

The location of a tube in the gastrointestinal tract , as well as the problems involved in crushing and administering solid dosage forms , creates a unique set of problems .
