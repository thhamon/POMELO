Monoamine oxidase inhibitors .
A perspective on their use in the elderly .
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) are mainly used in psychiatry for the treatment of depressive disorders and in neurology for the treatment of Parkinson's disease .
While the classical , nonselective and nonreversible MAOIs , such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine , are characterised by the risk of inducing a hypertensive crisis when dietary tyramine is ingested , the selective monoamine oxidase- oxidase-B ( MAO-B ) inhibitor selegiline ( deprenyl ) and , even more so , the selective and reversible monoamine oxidase- oxidase-A ( MAO-A ) inhibitor moclobemide , are free from this potential interaction .
Drug tolerability data for the elderly show that moclobemide is one of the most well tolerated compounds .
Selegiline , especially when used in combination with levodopa , can cause anorexia , dry mouth , dyskinesia and , most problematic , orthostatic hypotension .
For the traditional MAOIs , phenelzine and tranylcypromine , published data are insufficient to be able to give a conclusive tolerability statement regarding the use of these compounds in elderly people .
Although orthostatic hypotension occurs in most patients treated with traditional MAOIs , the incidence in elderly patients with depression does not appear to be greater than that reported with tricyclic antidepressants .
