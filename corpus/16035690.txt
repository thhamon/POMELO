Health effects of garlic .
Garlic has long been used medicinally , most recently for its cardiovascular , antineoplastic , and antimicrobial properties .
Sulfur compounds , including allicin , appear to be the active components in the root bulb of the garlic plant .
Studies show significant but modest lipid- lipid-lowering effects and antiplatelet activity .
Significant blood pressure reduction is not consistently noted .
There is some evidence for antineoplastic activity and insufficient evidence for clinical antimicrobial activity .
Side effects generally are mild and uncommon .
Garlic appears to have no effect on drug metabolism , but patients taking anticoagulants should be cautious .
It seems prudent to stop taking high dosages of garlic seven to 10 days before surgery because garlic can prolong bleeding time .
