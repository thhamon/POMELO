Polyphenols: factors influencing their sensory properties and their effects on food and beverage preferences .
Bitterness and astringency are found in a variety of foods , including nuts , fruits , chocolate , tea , wine , and soymilk .
In fruits and beverages , the taste of bitterness and the tactile sensation of astringency are elicited primarily by flavanol polymers ( proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins ) .
Variations in proanthocyanidin composition , such as polymer size , extent of galloylation , and formation of derivatives , affect both bitterness and astringency .
In beverages , other factors also influence these sensations , including the pH and the levels of ethanol , sweetness , and viscosity .
Similarly , foods eaten with beverages can influence astringency .
For example , eating dark chocolate increases the astringency of red wine more than does milk chocolate .
Individuals perceive astringency differently because of variations in salivary flow rates , and preferences for and acceptance of a product may vary tremendously among individuals ; decreasing bitterness and  or astringency may not increase preference .
Factors influencing bitterness , astringency , and individual preference decisions are discussed .
