The impact of calories and fat content of meals on oral ziprasidone absorption: a randomized , open-label , crossover trial .
Food is known to increase the bioavailability of ziprasidone .
Therefore , we evaluated the effects of meals of differing caloric and fat content on steady-state ziprasidone exposure in a stable , treated group of subjects with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder , or psychotic disorder ( not otherwise specified ) who were already receiving oral ziprasidone as their standard therapy .
Patients took ziprasidone under 6 meal conditions in randomized sequences ( fasted , low calorie  low fat , low calorie  high fat , medium calorie  high fat , high calorie  low fat , and high calorie  high fat ) ; each crossover period was separated by at least 3 days for washout of the previous meal condition .
Serial blood samples were obtained over the 12 hours postdose .
The study was conducted from July 27 to September 28 of 2006. .
Maximum ziprasidone exposures in this study were observed with high-calorie meals ( 1000 kcal ) , which were nearly twice those observed under fasting conditions .
The medium-calorie meal ( 500 kcal ) was associated with exposures similar to the high-calorie meals .
Low-calorie meals ( 250 kcal ) were associated with exposures that were approximately 60% to 90% lower than those of medium- and high-calorie meals , and approached exposures seen under fasting conditions .
Fat content of the meal had no significant effect on ziprasidone absorption .
The ziprasidone exposures observed with medium- and high-calorie meals had less variability than those with low-calorie meals and under fasting conditions .
These results confirm that ziprasidone should be taken with food and that a meal equal to or greater than 500 kcal , irrespective of fat content , is required for optimal and reproducible bioavailability of the administered dose .
