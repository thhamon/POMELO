Dietary supplements , herbs and oral anticoagulants anticoagulants: the nature of the evidence .
In the US , the use of dietary supplements , including vitamins , minerals , amino acids , and herbal products , is extensive .
Nonetheless , the majority of patients report that they have little information about the risks , benefits , and adverse effects of medicines , or about their potential interactions with prescription drugs .
Patients taking warfarin are at particular risk of interactions with dietary supplements , yet approximately 30% use herbal or natural product supplements on a regular basis .
No current governmental regulations or voluntary programs address dietary supplement interactions with prescription drugs .
Case reports represent the majority of the evidence surrounding drug interactions between warfarin and dietary supplements .
Those of the highest quality include , as an assessment of causality , a modification of the recently published Drug Interaction Probability Scale .
Despite positive case reports , formal drug interaction studies are often negative , suggesting that numerous patient-specific influences other than the suspected interaction alone may be responsible for a particular observation .
The cranberry-juice  warfarin interaction is a recent example of such a discrepancy .
Healthcare providers can play an active role in improving quantity and the quality of case reports of interactions involving warfarin and dietary supplements .
A registry of anticoagulant interactions with dietary supplements has been proposed , and is currently being developed through Clotcare Online Resource ( http:   www.clotcare.com ) .
The goal of this registry is to obtain high quality case-based evidence of drug interactions between anticoagulants and dietary supplements , to define these interactions based on clinical and monitoring outcomes , and to analyze likelihood of causation using a modification of the Drug Interaction Probability Scale .
