Review article: cytochrome P450 enzyme , and transport protein mediated herb-drug interactions in renal transplant patients: grapefruit juice , St John's Wort - and beyond !
To survey the evidence for plant-products to modify cytochrome P450 enzyme , and transport protein mediated drug metabolism in renal transplant patients .
A literature search was performed to identify " in vitro " and " in vivo " research on plant-products that might cause overdosage or loss of efficacy of immunosuppressive drugs in transplant patients by the interaction mechanisms already characterized for grapefruit juice and St St. .
John's Wort .
The interaction mechanisms of St St. .
John's Wort by pregnane X-receptor mediated upregulation of cytochrome-P450 enzyme 3A4 and p-glycoprotein expression and of grapefruit juice by mechanism-based inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 suggest that many other plant products will likewise cause interactions with drugs because they occupy the same metabolic pathways .
The respective research on foods , spices and medicinal herbs is listed in a comprehensive table and weighted according to its strength of evidence to cause clinically relevant interactions .
Physicians supervising drug-regimes in renal transplant patients should be aware of plant products beyond SJW and GFJ to possibly cause overdosage or failure of drug-treatments by herb-drug interactions .
