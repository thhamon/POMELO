Drug-drug , drug-dietary supplement , and drug-citrus fruit and other food interactions interactions: what have we learned ?
Serious drug-drug interactions have contributed to recent U.S. .
market withdrawals and also recent nonapprovals of a few new molecular entities .
Many of these interactions involved the inhibition or induction of metabolizing enzymes and efflux transporters , resulting in altered systemic exposure and adverse drug reactions or loss of efficacy .
In addition to drug-drug interactions , drug-dietary supplement and drug-citrus fruit interactions , among others , could also cause adverse drug reactions or loss of efficacy and are important issues to consider in the evaluation of new drug candidates .
This commentary reviews ( 1 ) .
the current understanding of the mechanistic basis of these interactions , ( 2 ) .
issues to consider in the interpretation of study results , and ( 3 ) .
recent labeling examples to illustrate the translation of study results to information useful for patients and health care providers .
