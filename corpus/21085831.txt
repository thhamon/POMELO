Antituberculosis drugs: drug interactions , adverse effects , and use in special situations .
Part 2: second line drugs .
The main objectives of tuberculosis therapy are to cure the patients and to minimize the possibility of transmission of the bacillus to healthy subjects .
Adverse effects of antituberculosis drugs or drug interactions ( among antituberculosis drugs or between antituberculosis drugs and other drugs ) can make it necessary to modify or discontinue treatment .
We describe the general mechanism of action , absorption , metabolization , and excretion of the drugs used to treat multidrug resistant tuberculosis ( aminoglycosides , fluoroquinolones , cycloserine  terizidone , ethionamide , capreomycin , and para-aminosalicylic acid ) .
We describe adverse drug reactions and interactions ( with other drugs , food , and antacids ) , as well as the most appropriate approach to special situations , such as pregnancy , breastfeeding , liver failure , and kidney failure .
