The interaction of cigarette smoking and antioxidants .
Part I: diet and carotenoids .
It is logical that the requirement for antioxidant nutrients depends on a person's exposure to endogenous and exogenous reactive oxygen species .
Since cigarette smoking results in an increased cumulative exposure to reactive oxygen species from both sources , it would seem cigarette smokers would have an increased requirement for antioxidant nutrients .
Logic dictates that a diet high in antioxidant-rich foods such as fruits , vegetables , and spices would be both protective and a prudent preventive strategy for smokers .
This review examines available evidence of fruit and vegetable intake , and supplementation of antioxidant compounds by smokers in an attempt to make more appropriate nutritional recommendations to this population .
