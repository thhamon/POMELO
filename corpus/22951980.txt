Effect of grapefruit juice on bioavailability of montelukast .
The aim of this study was to investigate possible interactions between grapefruit juice and montelukast for up to 4 hours .
A prospective , crossover study with 23 healthy volunteers was performed in two sessions .
In the first session , volunteers were treated with oral montelukast 10 mg once daily with 250 ml water .
After a 10-day washout period , the same volunteers were treated with 10 mg montelukast with 250 ml grapefruit juice .
Blood samples were collected 2 , 3 , and 4 hours after drug administration and kept at -80bigasentcelcC after both applications .
Plasma samples were analyzed for montelukast concentration .
The mean plasma concentration of montelukast across all time intervals was significantly greater ( P = 0.0001 ) for those given grapefruit juice ( 517 , 484 , and 440 ) versus those treated with water ( 366 , 356 , and 292 ) .
Moreover , with respect to the time the sample was collected , there was no significant difference ( P = 0.13 ) in the mean total plasma concentration up to 4 hours after montelukast ingestion for either group .
There was a significant difference between the groups according to the area under curve with regard to marginal and cumulative values for all different time intervals ( P sentinf 0.05 ) .
Plasma concentration of montelukast was higher when administered with grapefruit juice , as compared to with water .
This may have been due to the effect of grapefruit on liver metabolism of montelukast and the cytochrome P450 system .
