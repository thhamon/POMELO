The antiparasitic moxidectin: safety , tolerability , and pharmacokinetics in humans .
A study in healthy male volunteers was completed to evaluate the safety , tolerability , and pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of the antiparasitic moxidectin ( MOX ) .
This drug is registered worldwide as a veterinary antiparasitic agent for use in companion and farm animals .
This is the first study of MOX in humans .
All subjects were between the ages of 18 and 45 years , with normal cardiac , hematologic , hepatic , and renal function .
Doses of MOX studied were 3 , 9 , 18 , and 36 mg in cohorts of 6 subjects each ( 5:1 , MOX:placebo ) .
At the 9-mg and 36-mg doses , two separate cohorts were completed , one in the fasted state and one after the consumption of a high-fat breakfast .
For all other cohorts , administration was in the fasted state .
Safety and tolerability were assessed by physical examinations , ongoing evaluation of adverse events ( AEs ) , and measurement of laboratory values .
Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) samples were collected just prior to dosing and at various time points until 80 days postdose .
Safety assessments from all dose groups studied suggested that MOX was generally safe and well tolerated , with a slightly higher incidence of transient , mild , and moderate central nervous system AEs as the dose increased as compared to placebo .
The PKs of MOX were dose proportional within the dose range studied , and the elimination half-life ( t1  2 elim ) was long ( mean: 20.2-35.1 days ) .
At the 9-mg and 36-mg doses , a high-fat breakfast was shown to delay and increase the overall absorption but did not increase maximal concentrations when compared to administration in the fasted state .
In summary , the results from this study indicate that MOX is safe and well tolerated in humans between the doses of 3 mg and 36 mg .
