Breast-feeding and responses to infant vaccines: constitutional and environmental factors .
Neonates and nursing infants are special with regard to immune development and vulnerability to infectious diseases .
Although breast-feeding is essential to modulate and prime immune defenses , vaccines ( an interventional prophylaxis ) are crucial to prevent and control infectious diseases .
During nursing , the type of feeding influences infants' natural defenses ( including gut colonization ) and their response to vaccines , both through cell-mediated immunity and specific antibody production .
Given the variety and combination of vaccine components ( antigens and excipients , preservative thimerosal , and aluminum adjuvants ) and route of administration , there is a need to examine the role of infant feeding practices in intended and nonintended outcomes of vaccination .
Maternal factors related to milk constituents ( nutrients and pollutants ) and feeding practices can affect response to vaccines .
Collectively , studies that compared type of feeding ( or used breast-feeding- breast-feeding-adjusted statistical models ) showed significant influence on some vaccines taken during infancy .
Nurslings deprived of the full benefit of breast-feeding could have altered immune responses affecting vaccine outcome .
In the absence of studies elucidating neurodevelopment ( including excitoxicity ) and immunotoxicity issues , vaccination practices should promote and support breast-feeding .
