The type and prevalence of supplement use by demographic and behavior characteristics were examined among members of a large group model health plan , including those with selected health conditions .
Data on the use of herbal medicines and dietary supplements among survey respondents were analyzed .
Questions employed a checklist for six specific NVNM supplements with optional write-ins .
A stratified random sample of 15 , 985 adult members of a large group model health maintenance organization in northern California , who were respondents to a 1999 general health survey .
Analyses were conducted with poststratification weighted data to reflect the actual age , gender , and geographic distribution of the adult membership from which the sample was drawn .
An estimated 32.7% of adult health plan members used at least one NVNM supplement .
The most frequently used herbs were Echinacea ( 14.7% ) and Gingko biloba ( 10.9% ) .
