Potential interaction between pomegranate juice and warfarin .
To my knowledge , no published reports have described an interaction between pomegranate juice and warfarin .
Investigators from previous animal and in vitro studies have reported a potential for pomegranate juice to inhibit metabolism involving the cytochrome P450 system , an effect that could translate into a clinical drug-diet interaction with warfarin .
This case report describes a 64-year-old Caucasian woman who was treated with warfarin for recurrent deep vein thrombosis .
She had been receiving a relatively stable dosage of warfarin 4 mg  day for several months , with stable international normalized ratios ( INRs ) .
During that time , the patient was consuming pomegranate juice 2-3 times  week .
She stopped drinking the juice , and her INRs became subtherapeutic .
Her dosage of warfarin was increased to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation .
No rechallenge with pomegranate juice was performed .
Use of the Drug Interaction Probability Scale indicated a possible relationship between the patient's subtherapeutic INR and the pomegranate juice .
Although this potential interaction needs to be explored further , clinicians should be aware of the interaction and thoroughly interview and closely monitor their patients who are receiving warfarin .
