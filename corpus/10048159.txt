Diet and risk of ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity hepatotoxicity: carbohydrate- -fat relationships in rats .
Nutritional status is a primary factor in the effects of xenobiotics and may be an important consideration in development of safety standards and assessment of risk .
One important xenobiotic consumed daily by millions of people worldwide is alcohol .
Some adverse effects of ethanol , such as alcohol liver disease , have been linked to diet .
For example , ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity in animal models requires diets that have a high percentage of the total calories as unsaturated fat .
However , little attention has been given to the role of carbohydrates ( or carbohydrate to fat ratio ) in the effects of this important xenobiotic on liver injury .
In the present study , adult male Sprague-Dawley rats ( 8-10  group ) were infused ( intragastrically ) diets high in unsaturated fat ( 25 or 45% total calories ) , sufficient protein ( 16% ) and ethanol ( 38% ) in the presence or absence of adequate carbohydrate ( 21 or 2.5% ) for 42-55 days ( d ) .
Animals infused ethanol-containing diets adequate in carbohydrate developed steatosis , but had no other signs of hepatic pathology .
However , rats infused with the carbohydrate- carbohydrate-deficient diet had a 4-fold increase in serum ALT levels ( p sentinf 0.05 ) , an unexpectedly high ( 34-fold ) induction of hepatic microsomal CYP2E1 apoprotein ( p sentinf 0.001 ) , and focal necrosis .
The strong positive association between low dietary carbohydrate , enhanced CYP2E1 induction and hepatic necrosis suggests that in the presence of low carbohydrate intake , ethanol induction of CYP2E1 is enhanced to levels sufficient to cause necrosis , possibly through reactive oxygen species and other free radicals generated by CYP2E1 metabolism of ethanol and unsaturated fatty acids .
