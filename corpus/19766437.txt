[Severe overdose in vitamin K antagonist secondary to grapefruit juice absorption]. .
Vitamin K antagonists ( VKA ) are very currently used .
Nevertheless , they are known to interact with numerous drugs and foods .
Grapefruit juice is known to interact with some drugs metabolized by the enterocytary cytochrome P450 3A4 but its interaction with drugs as VKA that have a good biodisponibility is not clearly demonstrated .
We report here the case of a woman treated with VKA in whom massive absorption of grapefruit juice entailed an excessive VKA dosage and a severe haemorrhage .
