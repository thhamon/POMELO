The influence of gender and food on the pharmacokinetics of sodium oxybate oral solution in healthy subjects .
Sodium oxybate ( Xyrem ; gamma-hydroxybutyrate ) oral solution was recently approved in the United States for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy .
Two single-center , randomized , open-label studies in healthy volunteers receiving single oral 4.5-g doses of sodium oxybate evaluated effects of ( 1 ) gender on oxybate pharmacokinetics and ( 2 ) food on its oral bioavailability .
In the latter study , one dose was administered after an overnight fast , another after a high-fat meal ; 1 week separated treatments .
Sodium oxybate pharmacokinetics was not significantly different between sexes .
However , food significantly altered the bioavailability of oxybate by decreasing mean peak plasma concentration , increasing median time-to-peak concentration , and decreasing the area under the plasma concentration-time curve .
Food did not affect elimination and urinary excretion of unchanged drug .
No dose adjustment of sodium oxybate based on sex is indicated .
Although significant food effects were observed , these are minimized in patients by the nocturnal dosing of sodium oxybate hours after the evening meal at a consistent time interval following food ingestion .
