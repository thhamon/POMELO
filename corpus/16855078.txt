Tyramine pressor sensitivity during treatment with the selegiline transdermal system 6 mg  24 h in healthy subjects .
The oral tyramine pressor test was administered to healthy males during treatment with a selegiline transdermal system ( STS ; 6 mg  24 h ) .
The tyramine sensitivity factor ( TSF ) was calculated from the ratio of baseline and on-treatment tyramine pressor doses .
The tyramine sensitivity factor value following 9 days of treatment with the selegiline transdermal system was 1.85 +  - 0.10. .
Extended treatment , 33 days , produced a small , clinically non-meaningful increase in this value .
The tyramine sensitivity factor for the selegiline transdermal system was similar to that following treatment with 10 mg  d of oral selegiline capsules but more than 20 times less than observed during tranylcypromine treatment .
A larger increase in the tyramine sensitivity factor was observed following extended selegiline transdermal system treatment at a higher dose ( 12 mg  24 h ) , which was significantly decreased following coadministration of tyramine capsules with a meal .
These results suggest a wide tyramine safety margin for the selegiline transdermal system and provide evidence that the 6-mg  24-h selegiline transdermal system can be administered safely without dietary tyramine restrictions .
