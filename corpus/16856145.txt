Effects of tyramine administration in Parkinson's disease patients treated with selective MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline .
Rasagiline is a novel , potent , and selective MAO-B inhibitor shown to be effective for Parkinson's disease .
Traditional nonselective MAO inhibitors have been associated with dietary tyramine interactions that can induce hypertensive reactions .
To test safety , tyramine challenges ( 50-75 mg ) were performed in 72 rasagiline- rasagiline-treated and 38 placebo-treated Parkinson's disease ( PD ) patients at the end of two double-blind placebo-controlled trials of rasagiline .
An abnormal pressor response was prespecified as three consecutive measurements of systolic blood pressure ( BP ) increases of sentsupor= 30 mm Hg and  or bradycardia of sentinf 40 beats  min .
In the first study involving 55 patients with early PD on rasagiline monotherapy , no patients randomized to rasagiline ( 1 mg  2 mg ; n = 38 ) or placebo ( n = 17 ) developed systolic BP ( SBP ) or heart rate changes indicative of a tyramine reaction .
In the second trial involving 55 levodopa- levodopa-treated patients , 3 of 22 subjects on rasagiline 0.5 mg  day and 1 of 21 subjects on placebo developed asymptomatic , self-limiting SBP elevations sentsupor= 30 mm Hg on three measurements .
No subject on 1 mg  day rasagiline ( 0  12 ) experienced significant BP or heart rate changes following tyramine ingestion .
These data demonstrate that rasagiline 0.5 to 2 mg daily is not associated with clinically significant tyramine reactions and can be used as monotherapy or adjunct to levodopa in PD patients without specific dietary tyramine restriction .
