The background against which antidepressants are discussed includes an overview of the cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) system ( which now contains over 500 P450 genes ) , the concepts of enzyme specificity and selectivity , the roles of genetics and nonpharmacologic environmental factors , and examples of beneficial and detrimental drug and diet interactions .
The comparative profiles of the various antidepressants are then presented with consideration given to their roles as substrates , inhibitors , and inducers of P450 enzymes such as CYP1A2 , 2B6 , 2C , 2D6 , and 3A4. .
