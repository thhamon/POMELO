Clinical consequences of polypharmacy in elderly: expect the unexpected , think the unthinkable .
Multiple medication use has been coined 'polypharmacy' .
Polypharmacy is highly prevalent in older patients secondary to the increased number of co-morbid disease states with ageing .
Existing practice guidelines recommend multiple drug use for certain chronic diseases ( i.e. , HIV , tuberculosis , hypertension , etc. ) .
A polypharmacologic approach for certain diseases has been shown to improve therapeutic response , decrease morbidity and mortality .
On the contrary , polypharmacy may induce iatrogenic complications that are often unseen prior to the initiation of medicinal regimens .
This paper will review the potential clinical consequences of polypharmacy in the elderly and common medication administration errors that may occur .
Consequences of polypharmacy include adverse drug effects , drug-drug interactions , disease-drug interactions , food- food-drug interactions , nutraceutical-drug interactions and medication cascade effect .
Medication administration errors , such as phonetic confusion , flip-flopping dosing errors and pill visual-cue errors , are also reviewed .
Prescribing for the elderly , whose medications are vast in number , is often uncharted physiologic territory .
The clinician must expect the unexpected and think of the unthinkable in the geriatric patient , when dealing with polypharmacy and the potential consequences .
