Understanding the grapefruit- drug interaction .
The inhibitory interaction of grapefruit juice and CYP3A4 medication metabolism was discovered in 1989. .
CYP3A4 enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of more than 60% of orally-administered drugs .
Grapefruit components inhibit CYP3A4 drug oxidation and P-glycoprotein transportation , allowing more systemic drug bioavailability .
This inhibitory interaction should be kept in mind when prescribing drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 , such as orally administered midazolam , triazolam , and diazepam .
