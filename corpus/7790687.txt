Family medicine residents' knowledge and attitudes about drug-nutrient interactions .
The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations ( JCAHO ) requires that health professionals recognize the importance of drug-nutrient interactions and educate patients to prevent adverse effects .
Drug-nutrient interactions are an important issue in medical practice , but it is not clear how or if physicians are trained in this issue .
This investigation was a needs assessment that examined attitudes and knowledge about drug-nutrient interactions that was examined in a national sample of 834 family medicine residents in 56 residency programs .
Most reported they had little or no formal training in drug-nutrient interactions in medical school ( 83% ) or residency ( 80% ) .
However , 79% believed it was the physician's responsibility to inform patients about drug-nutrient interactions , although many thought pharmacists ( 75% ) and dietitians ( 66% ) share this responsibility .
Overall , residents correctly answered 61% +  - 19 of fourteen drug-nutrient interaction knowledge items .
There was a slight increase in drug-nutrient knowledge as year of residency increased .
Physicians' knowledge of drug-nutrient interactions may be improved by including nutrition education in the topics taught by physicians , nutritionists , and pharmacists using several educational strategies .
Nutrition educators in particular can play a role in curriculum development about drug-nutrient interactions by developing , refining , and evaluating materials and educational tools .
Nutrition educators need to provide this information in academic settings for the training of all health professionals as well as in patient education settings such as hospitals and public health clinics .
