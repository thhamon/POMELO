Drug interactions and consequences of sodium restriction .
Dietary sodium restriction has several clinical benefits , particularly that of enhancing the antihypertensive action of diuretics and other blood pressure-lowering drugs .
In individuals who form hypercalciuric stones , sodium restriction along with thiazide diuretics helps to reduce urinary calcium .
However , there are adverse consequences of sodium restriction , particularly in elderly patients with impaired sodium conservation mechanisms .
Ischemic and nephrotoxic injuries are induced more readily in sodium- sodium-depleted animals and patients because of impaired renal hemodynamics and activation of the renin-angiotensin system .
Acute renal failure can be precipitated by sodium restriction and concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs , and immunosuppressive drugs .
Dietary sodium restriction in animals enhances the chronic nephrotoxicity of cyclosporine and tacrolimus , whereas similar doses of these drugs do not produce structural damage in salt- salt-replete animals .
Maneuvers that block angiotensin II protect against renal scarring and drug-induced arteriolopathy in this model .
Sodium restriction can enhance the renal tubular reabsorption of drugs such as lithium , leading to toxic blood concentrations .
Calcium antagonists may have better efficacy when prescribed to salt- salt-replete hypertensive persons .
Finally , there is evidence that activation of the renin-angiotensin system by sodium depletion will enhance the growth of cysts in animal models of cystic renal disease .
In individual patients , the effects of sodium restriction by diet should balance anticipated benefits against any possible adverse consequences .
