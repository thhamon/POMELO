Generalised urticaria in a young woman treated with clomipramine and after ingestion of codfish .
We report a case of generalized dermatitis and itch induced by a possible drug-food interaction in a young woman who was consuming clomipramine for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) .
A 33-year-old woman affected by anxiety symptoms presented to our observation for a clinical evaluation .
After psychiatric evaluation , the diagnosis of OCD was performed according to DSM-IV-TR and a pharmacological treatment with clomipramine ( 75-100 mg  day ) plus alprazolam ( 0.5 mg  day ) was started .
About one month later , the patient developed a severe generalized urticaria with intense itch .
A new anamnesis revealed that on the day before the development of the skin rash , no other drug was consumed and the patient had eaten codfish ; clomipramine was then gradually discontinued and changed into paroxetine ( 30 mg  day ) .
At the moment the patient does not show any OCD related symptom and any adverse event to paroxetine treatment has been recorded .
We postulate a possible interaction between clomipramine and codfish ingestion .
Allergic potential of clomipramine was investigated , while clomipramine de-challenge induced a decrease of the skin rash , the drug re-challenge performed one month later did not induce any adverse event .
In contrast , when the combined re-challenge of codfish and clomipramine was performed urticaria was newly observed .
The Naranjo Probability Scale Score suggested a probable causal relationship between drug-food interaction and the skin rash .
In conclusion , we suggest evaluating also the complete risk of drug-food interaction occurring on clomipramine treatment .
