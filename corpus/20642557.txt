Effect of high-dose cranberry juice on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin in patients .
Case reports suggest an association between cranberry juice and potentiation of warfarin .
Studies using 240 ml of cranberry juice daily demonstrated no interaction .
It is unknown if higher amounts of cranberry juice will interact with warfarin .
Cranberry juice at 240 ml twice daily does not alter the pharmacodynamics of warfarin .
To determine if high-dose cranberry juice ( 240 ml twice daily ) alters the pharmacodynamic action of warfarin .
Ten male patients taking stable doses of warfarin were given cranberry juice at 240 ml twice daily for 7 days .
Prothrombin times were drawn at baseline and days 2 , 6 and 8 after administration of the juice .
Prothrombin times were averaged for each day and mean times were compared from each study day to baseline using repeated measures ANOVA .
There was no statistical difference between mean prothrombin time at baseline and any day tested during juice administration .
Cranberry juice ( 240 ml twice daily for 1 week ) did not alter the pharmacodynamics of warfarin in patients .
