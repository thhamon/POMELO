Safety and potential of drug interactions of caspofungin and voriconazole in multimorbid patients .
Due to their broad antimycotic spectrum and the relatively low rate of side effects , the two antifungals caspofungin and voriconazole are considered as attractive therapeutic alternatives to amphotericin B. .
However , treatment of severe mycotic infections in patients taking co-medication is associated with the risk of severe adverse drug interactions .
The risk of such interactions is increased if voriconazole and , much less pronounced caspofungin , are co-administered with drugs which have an inducing or inhibiting effect on the CYP 450 system , primarily on the isoenzymes CYP2C19 , CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 CYP3A4. .
This review provides a comprehensive overview on the potential drug interactions of caspofungin and voriconazole in multimorbid patients .
