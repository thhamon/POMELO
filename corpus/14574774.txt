[Classical monoamine oxidase inhibitor inhibitor: not registered for , but still a place in the treatment of depression]. .
In the Netherlands monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors are not registered for the treatment of patients with depression .
The classical , nonselective MAO inhibitors- -phenelzine and tranylcypromine tranylcypromine- -are effective but their use is associated with interactions ( with tyramine in food , sympathicomimetics and serotonine re-uptake inhibitors ) and side-effects ( hypertension , hypotension , headache , sleep disturbances and neuromuscular symptoms in particular ) .
Therefore , the classical MAO inhibitors are indicated only in depressive disorders that are unresponsive to the first stages of treatment .
Taking this selection into account , treatment should be long-term to avoid relapse .
