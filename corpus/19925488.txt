Two cases of wheat- wheat-dependent anaphylaxis induced by aspirin administration but not by exercise .
Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) have been reported to enhance the symptoms of wheat- wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis ( WDEIA ) .
In contrast to many reports on WDEIA , there have been only a few reports of wheat- wheat-dependent aspirin- aspirin-induced anaphylaxis not induced by the combination of wheat and exercise .
Two patients with wheat- wheat-dependent anaphylaxis underwent provocation tests to clarify the cause of their symptoms .
Skin- Skin-prick testing ( SPT ) was also performed with and without administration of aspirin .
Specific IgE antibody to wheat , gluten , and omega-5 gliadin were examined .
In the provocation tests , anaphylactic reactions were not induced by wheat or aspirin alone or by the combination of wheat and exercise , but were induced by the combination of wheat and aspirin .
An increase in the blood histamine level was detected after provocation in both patients .
Pretreatment with aspirin enhanced the SPT reactions to wheat and gluten in both patients .
Specific IgE antibodies to wheat and gluten were expressed in the serum of both patients , and specific omega-5 gliadin IgE antibody was detected in the serum of one patient .
We present two cases of specific wheat- wheat-dependent anaphylaxis induced by aspirin but not by exercise .
We suggest that pretreatment with aspirin under controlled conditions is useful to confirm the diagnosis of food allergy when a challenge test with food alone or with food and exercise fails to induce positive reactions .
