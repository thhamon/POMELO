The making of a user friendly MAOI diet .
Many monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) diets are considered to be excessively restrictive and founded on poor scientific evidence .
We present a safe and practical MAOI diet based on the related clinical and analytic data .
We used a critical review of the literature and our own tyramine assay results to categorize foods to be restricted absolutely , taken in moderation only , or unrestricted .
We recommend that users avoid aged cheese ; aged or cured meats ( e.g e.g. , air-dried sausage ) ; any potentially spoiled meat , poultry , or fish ; broad ( fava ) bean pods ; Marmite concentrated yeast extract ; sauerkraut ; soy sauce and soy bean condiments ; and tap beer .
Wine and domestic bottled or canned beer are considered safe when consumed in moderation .
Other foods not mentioned are considered unrestricted .
The concerns about perpetuating an overly restrictive MAOI diet include the avoidance by prescribers of a potentially useful treatment option , excessive limitations on lifestyle for patients , and increased risk to patients secondary to noncompliance with the diet .
We propose an MAOI diet that has a solid scientific and clinical basis and that is , above all , practical .
