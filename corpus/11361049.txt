The bioavailability of the novel nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor GW420867X is unaffected by food in healthy male volunteers .
The effect of food on the bioavailability of GW420867X , a novel nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor , was investigated in 15 young , healthy , male volunteers .
A single oral dose of GW420867X 100 mg was administered in the fasted state , after a high-fat meal , and after a meal of normal fat composition .
Tolerability and pharmacokinetic sampling were assessed at baseline and up to 600 hours .
The median concentration-time plots for each treatment group were essentially superimposable .
Neither the rate nor the extent of absorption of GW420867X was significantly affected by food .
The median time to peak plasma concentration was 3 to 4 hours , irrespective of treatment .
Pairwise comparisons using the fasted treatment as the comparator showed no impact of food on GW420867X pharmacokinetics .
GW420867X was well tolerated .
There were no serious or treatment-limiting adverse events ; all episodes reported were rated as mild to moderate .
The bioavailability of GW420867X was unaffected by food .
GW420867X may be administered independently of food and fat intake .
