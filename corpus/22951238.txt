Dietary restrictions and drug interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors: an update .
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) are effective treatments for depression that has atypical features or that has failed to respond to other antidepressants .
However , MAOIs are underused because clinicians are concerned about dietary and drug interactions with this class of medication .
Hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome can occur in rare cases due to interactions between MAOIs and foods containing tyramine as well as interactions with serotonergic and sympathomimetic agents .
A better understanding of the foods and drugs that can cause adverse reactions , as well as knowledge of newer MAOIs with mechanisms of action and delivery methods that reduce these risks , may help clinicians to consider the use of these medications , when appropriate , in their patients with depression .
