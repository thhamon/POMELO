[Grapefruit consumption and food-drug interaction hazard]. .
To estimate the prevalence of grapefruit consumption in patients admitted to a tertiary care emergency department ( ED ) and its potential impact on the risk of fruit- drug interaction .
Observational cross-sectional study conducted in a medical ED between July and December 2009. .
Data analysis searched for the main drugs which can dramatically interact with grapefruit and for adverse drug events ( ADEs ) .
Among the 162 patients who were interviewed , 59 ( 36% ) reported grapefruit consumption ( regardless form or frequency ) and 11 ( 7% ) were prescribed a treatment with a risk of fruit- drug interaction .
No ADE could be related to an interaction with grapefruit .
Calcium channel blockers and HMG-coA-reductase inhibitors mostly accounted for drugs at risk of interaction in grapefruit consumers .
These results give evidence of the sizeable risk of grapefruit- drug interaction in the prescriptions of patients admitted to a medical ED , with a high proportion of commonly used medicines but poor clinical consequences .
