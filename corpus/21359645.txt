Drug and dietary interactions of warfarin and novel oral anticoagulants anticoagulants: an update .
Clinicians and patients around the world have been intrigued by the concept of developing an oral anticoagulant with a broad therapeutic window and few drug and dietary interactions that can be administered at fixed doses with no or minimal monitoring .
The recently approved oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran , along with the emerging oral anti-factor Xa inhibitors , rivaroxaban , apixaban , and edoxaban , have been developed to address many of the shortcomings of warfarin therapy .
As warfarin is associated with extensive food and drug interactions , there is also a need to consider such interactions with the new oral anticoagulants .
While to date few drug and dietary interactions have been reported with the new oral anticoagulants , it is still early in their development and clinical use cycle .
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles will have to be closely accounted for when determining the likelihood of a potential drug interaction prior to therapy initiation .
As the list of drugs and supplements that interact with warfarin is continuously expanding , and the knowledge on drug interactions with the novel oral anticoagulants is still in its infancy , clinicians need to be vigilant when initiating any of these agents or when any changes in the patient's medication profile occur and perform a close screening for potential drug and dietary interactions .
The objective of this paper is to give an update on drug and dietary interactions with warfarin and the novel oral anticoagulants , dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban , and edoxaban .
