Cardiovascular safety of anagrelide in healthy subjects: effects of caffeine and food intake on pharmacokinetics and adverse reactions .
Essential thrombocythaemia ( ET ) is a rare clonal myeloproliferative disorder characterized by a sustained elevation in platelet count and megakaryocyte hyperplasia .
Anagrelide is used in the treatment of ET , where it has been shown to reduce platelet count .
Anagrelide is metabolized by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 1A2 , and previous studies of the effect of food on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of anagrelide were conducted prior to the identification of the active metabolite , 3-hydroxyanagrelide .
The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of food and caffeine on the pharmacokinetics of anagrelide and its active metabolite , 3-hydroxyanagrelide , to monitor electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameters following drug administration , and to document the relationship between palpitations , ECG changes and caffeine caffeine intake Thirty-five healthy subjects who received 1 mg of anagrelide following either a 10-h fast or within 30 min of a standardized breakfast , including two cups of coffee , were studied .
Time to maximum ( peak ) plasma concentration ( C ( max ) ) of anagrelide was 4.0 h in the fed and 1.5 h in the fasted group ( p sentinf 0.05 ) ; similar results were observed for 3-hydroxyanagrelide .
The mean C ( max ) of anagrelide was 4.45 bigasentpleq 2.32 ng  mL and 5.08 bigasentpleq 2.99 ng  mL in the fed  caffeine and fasted groups , respectively ; peak concentrations were higher for 3-hydroxyanagrelide in both the fed  caffeine and fasted groups .
The most frequent adverse events ( AEs ) were headache ( 60 % ) and palpitations ( 40 % ) .
There were no serious AEs and all ECGs were normal , although significant reductions in PR interval , QRS length and QT interval were observed in both groups .
Heart rate increased after anagrelide administration in both fed  caffeine and fasted states ( p sentinf 0.01 ) ; however , increased heart rate was significantly more frequent in the fed  caffeine state than in the fasted state ( p sentinf 0.001 for heart rate increase in the first hour after drug administration ) .
There was a trend towards a greater heart rate increase in subjects reporting palpitations than in those without ( mean heart rate bigasentpleq SD at 1 h: 10.1 bigasentpleq 6.4 vs. .
8.0 bigasentpleq 8.4 beats  min [p = 0.35] ; at 4 h: 12.7 bigasentpleq 7.5 vs. .
9.1 bigasentpleq 8.8 beats  min [p = 0.10] , respectively ) .
We conclude that food  caffeine delayed absorption of anagrelide .
Anagrelide was generally well tolerated and had small effects on ECG parameters and heart rate .
Caffeine may be implicated in a higher increase in heart rate and increased frequency of palpitations observed following administration of anagrelide with food  caffeine versus fasting .
