Calcium supplementation .
Calcium is necessary for the prevention and treatment of diseases such as osteoporosis , hypertension , and , possibly , colon cancer .
Supplementation is useful when dietary calcium intake is low , as is the current situation in North America .
There are many factors to consider before recommending any one form of supplement .
A consideration for calcium carbonate tablets is whether the tablet disintegrates and whether or not a lack of food or acid in the stomach will hinder utilization .
Other forms of calcium , particularly the chelated calcium salts , are better absorbed in fasting achlorhydric subjects but have less calcium per gram of supplement .
Interaction of calcium with other mineral nutrients and the presence of contaminating metals has focused attention on safety .
Based on present evidence , chelated calcium and refined calcium carbonate tablets ( including those labeled as antacids ) may be safely and effectively ingested by most people at doses generally recommended for treatment or prevention of osteoporosis .
One should not exceed 2 , 000 mg of calcium , except at the advice of their health care provider , as inadvertent mineral deficiencies may arise .
Persons at risk for developing milk- alkali syndrome , such as thiazide users and persons with renal failure , should be identified and monitored for alkalosis and hypercalcemia when using calcium supplements .
