[Acetaminophen use by chronic alcohol abusers: a therapeutic dose may be too much for the liver] liver]. .
Two patients , both women aged 31 and 73 years , were admitted with chest pain and coma , respectively .
They had very high aspartate aminotransferase aminotransferase levels , accompanied by relatively low alanine aminotransferase aminotransferase levels .
The second patient had developed acute liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy .
Both patients were chronic alcohol abusers and had taken therapeutic doses of acetaminophen for a couple of days .
The marked elevation of the aminotransferase levels and the rapid decline of these levels after discontinuing the use of acetaminophen and alcohol led to the diagnosis of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity .
In chronic alcohol abusers , cytochrome P450 2E1 is induced and the amount of glutathione is depleted .
This combination causes the formation of a relatively large amount of the radical N-acetyl-p- N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine and a low potential to detoxify this metabolite , so that even small amounts of acetaminophen may cause liver damage .
It is recommended that chronic alcohol abusers ( more than four alcoholic beverages per day ) use no more than 2 g acetaminophen per day .
