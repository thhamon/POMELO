Phase I clinical trial of oral rigosertib in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes .
The multi-kinase inhibitor rigosertib ( ON 01910.Na ) induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis in myeloblasts , while sparing normal cells .
The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic profile , maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) , safety , and clinical activity of an oral formulation of rigosertib in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) .
For pharmacokinetic studies , patients received rigosertib in single escalating weekly doses .
To determine the MTD , patient cohorts received escalating doses of rigosertib twice daily for 14 d of a 21-d cycle .
Overall , 37 patients were treated .
Rigosertib exposure increased with escalating oral doses .
Mean absolute oral bioavailability ranged from 13bigasentdot9% ( fed ) to 34bigasentdot8% ( fasting ) in 12 patients treated at the 560 mg b.i.d. .
dose level .
Dose-limiting toxicity ( grade 3 dysuria and shortness of breath ) occurred at the 700 mg b.i.d. .
dose .
Five patients experienced grade 3 non-haematological toxicity , including symptoms of urothelial inflammation , hypotension and syncope , fatigue and abdominal pain .
Encouraging signs of clinical activity included two bone marrow complete remissions in refractory anaemia with excess blasts type 1 patients previously treated with azacitidine .
In addition , four patients each achieved transfusion independence and haematological improvements .
In conclusion , oral rigosertib is bioavailable and well tolerated , and has clinical activity in patients with MDS .
