Warfarin-cranberry juice interaction resulting in profound hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding .
Few published reports have suggested a substantial interaction between cranberry juice and warfarin , although a definite link could not be established .
We encountered a patient taking stable doses of warfarin who developed major bleeding and high INR soon after starting daily cranberry juice .
No other identifiable reasons for the high INR were apparent .
The patient resumed his usual dose of warfarin after stopping the juice .
This case suggests a definite relationship between cranberry juice and warfarin .
