Cola beverage and delayed elimination of methotrexate .
To report a case of severe delayed methotrexate elimination attributable to consumption of a cola beverage .
To investigate unexplained low urinary pH in a lymphoma patient treated with high-dose methotrexate .
Unexpected urinary acidity , despite administration of large amounts of sodium bicarbonate , could be attributed to repeated consumption of a cola beverage .
It resulted in a delayed elimination of methotrexate and acute renal failure .
Discontinuation of cola drinks , increase in calcium folinate rescue and in sodium bicarbonate allowed satisfactory elimination of methotrexate on day 12 after infusion and recovery from renal impairment without other severe toxicity .
No other cause of delay in methotrexate elimination could be identified .
Cola beverages have a low pH due to their phosphoric acid content that is excreted by renal route .
We recommend patients receiving high dose methotrexate abstain from any cola drink within 24 h before and during methotrexate administration and until complete elimination of the drug .
