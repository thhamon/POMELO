Soybean glycinin improves HDL-C and suppresses the effects of rosuvastatin on hypercholesterolemic rats .
This study was an investigation of the effects of ingesting a daily dose of isolated glycinin soy protein ( 11S globulin ) , in association with rosuvastatin , on the control of hypercholesterolemia in experimental animals .
Male Wistar rats were kept in individual cages under appropriate controlled conditions of temperature , light and humidity .
The animals were divided into five groups ( n = 9 ) : 1 ) standard ( STD ) : fed on casein as protein source ; 2 ) hypercholesterolemic ( HC ) : STD plus 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid ; 3 ) HC+11S: hypercholesterolemic + glycinin ( 300 mg  kg  day ) ; 4 ) HC+ROS: hypercholesterolemic + rosuvastatin ( 10 mg  kg  day ) ; 5 ) HC+11S+ROS: HC diet , the 11S protein and the drug in the doses given in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .
The protein and the drug were administered by gavage for 28 days .
The results indicated that the addition of 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid induced hypercholesterolemia in the animals without interfering with their weight gain .
A single daily dose of glycinin contributed an additional 2.8% of dietary protein intake and demonstrated its functional role , particularly in raising HDL-C , decreasing triglycerides in the liver and improving the atherogenic index in animals exposed to a hypercholesterolemic diet .
Most of the beneficial effects of the isolated treatments disappeared when the drug ( rosuvastatin ) and the protein ( glycinin ) were taken simultaneously .
The association was shown not to interact additively , as noted in the plasma levels of total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol , and in the significant increase of cholesterol in the liver .
Studies are in progress to identify the effects of peptides derived from the 11S globulin and their role in cholesterol metabolism .
