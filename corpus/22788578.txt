Drug interaction potential of resveratrol .
Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol that is often used as a food supplement .
Many positive health effects , including cardio protection , tumor suppression , and immune modulation , are associated with the intake of resveratrol .
Resveratrol is well tolerated in healthy subjects without any comedication .
However , supplemental doses of resveratrol in the range of 1 g  day or above by far exceed the natural intake through food .
Whether resveratrol-drug interactions can be harmful in patients taking additional medications remains unknown .
Recent in vivo studies and clinical trials indicate a possible drug-drug drug interaction potential using high-dosage formulations .
In this review , the known in vitro and in vivo effects of resveratrol on various cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) isoenzymes are summarized .
They are discussed in relation to clinically relevant plasma concentrations in humans .
We conclude that resveratrol may lead to interactions with various CYPs , especially when taken in high doses .
Aside from systemic CYP inhibition , intestinal interactions must also be considered .
They can potentially lead to reduced first-pass metabolism , resulting in higher systemic exposure to certain coadministrated CYP substrates .
Therefore , patients who ingest high doses of this food supplement combined with additional medications may be at risk of experiencing clinically relevant drug-drug interactions .
