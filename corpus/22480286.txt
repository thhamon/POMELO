Dabigatran: a new chapter in anticoagulation .
For the last 60 years warfarin has been the cornerstone for chronic anticoagulation in prevention of ischemic strokes and systemic embolization .
Warfarin therapy has several limitations including frequent monitoring and various food and significant drug interactions , which make it a less than ideal chronic oral anticoagulant .
The continued search for safe , effective , medications with predictable pharmacokinetic profiles has led to newer alternatives .
Dabigatran is a potent reversible , competitive direct thrombin inhibitor which is available as the prodrug , Dabigatran etexilate .
It was first approved in Europe and recently in October 2010 , the US food and drug administration ( FDA ) has approved the use of this novel oral anticoagulation for prevention of stroke in those with non valvular atrial fibrillation .
This review will cover the chemical structure , mechanism of action , pharmacokinetic profile , clinical trials , dosage , clinical implication and adverse effects of dabigatran .
