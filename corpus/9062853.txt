Studies on stannous fluoride toothpaste and gel ( 1 ) .
Antimicrobial properties and staining potential in vitro .
Stannous fluoride ( SF ) in a toothpaste vehicle has the potential to provide anticaries and plaque inhibitory benefits through the fluoride and antimicrobial stannous moieties respectively .
Dental staining , however , can occur by precipitation of dietary chromogens onto the tooth surface by stannous ions .
These studies in vitro compare the antimicrobial profile and propensity to cause tea staining of a number of stannous fluoride formulations .
The formulations used were 2 SF toothpaste products ( SF1 , SF2 ) , 2 experimental SF plus stannous pyrophosphate toothpastes ( SFSP1 , SFSP2 ) , a SF gel ( G ) and a NaF toothpaste ( C ) .
Maximum inhibitory dilution values against a range of oral bacteria were determined by agar dilution .
Tea staining was measured spectrophotometrically on saliva coated clear acrylic blocks exposed to slurries of the paste or gel .
All formulations showed antimicrobial activity with the order of greatest activity downwards being C , SF2 , SF1 , SFSP1 , SFSP2 and G. .
Tea staining at 10 exposures was in the following descending order of optical density SFSP1 , SFSP2 , G. .
C , SF1 , SF2 , water control .
The antimicrobial profile of G was similar to that of SF , whereas that of the other formulations were varied but similar to a detergent profile .
The difference in staining suggested considerable variation in availability of stannous ions in the formulations .
However , the propensity for stannous ions to stain must be balanced against the stain removal propensity of the contained detergents in the toothpaste formulations .
In conclusion , the variation in antimicrobial activity and more particularly staining activity of the formulations suggest the products will vary in activity in vivo .
