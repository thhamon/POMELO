Chronopharmacology of anti-convulsive therapy .
Approximately one-third of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures despite antiepileptic therapy .
Many seizures occur in diurnal , sleep  wake , circadian , or even monthly patterns .
The relationship between biomarkers and state changes is still being investigated , but early results suggest that some of these patterns may be related to endogenous circadian patterns whereas others may be related to wakefulness and sleep or both .
Chronotherapy , the application of treatment at times of greatest seizure susceptibility , is a technique that may optimize seizure control in selected patients .
It may be used in the form of differential dosing , as preparations designed to deliver sustained or pulsatile drug delivery or in the form of 'zeitgebers' that shift endogenous rhythms .
Early trials in epilepsy suggest that chronopharmacology may provide improved seizure control compared with conventional treatment in some patients .
The present article reviews chronopharmacology in the treatment of epilepsy as well as future treatment avenues .
