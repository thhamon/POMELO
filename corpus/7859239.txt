Effect of meals and dosage-form modification on theophylline bioavailability from a 24-hour sustained-release delivery system .
The bioavailability of theophylline from an extended-release formulation ( Uni-Dur ) intended for once-daily administration was assessed in a randomized , single-dose , five-way crossover study to determine the effects of food and breaking the tablet , and the bioequivalence of two dosage strengths .
The five treatments given at 1-week intervals were ( 1 ) immediate-release theophylline ( Slo-Phyllin ) 5 x 100 mg to fasting subjects as a reference treatment ; ( 2 ) sustained-release Uni-Dur 600-mg theophylline tablet to fasting subjects ; ( 3 ) Uni-Dur 600-mg tablet after a high-fat meal ; ( 4 ) Uni-Dur 600-mg dose administered as two half tablets to fasting subjects ; and ( 5 ) Uni-Dur 400-mg tablet to fasting subjects .
Serial blood samples were collected immediately before and for 57 hours after dosing .
The mean relative extents of absorption for the four Uni-Dur treatments were not significantly different from Slo-Phyllin treatment or from each other ( 84.30 +  - 23.6% , 600 mg , fasting ; 88.73 +  - 18.63% , 600 mg , fed ; 93.65 +  - 19.67% , half tablet ; and 92.87 +  - 19.5% , 400 mg , fasting ) .
The maximum theophylline serum concentrations with Uni-Dur were significantly lower and the times to reach peak concentrations were significantly longer than with Slo-Phyllin .
Differences noted among the four Uni-Dur treatments were as follows: the time to peak theophylline concentration was significantly longer in the fed state ( 17.09 hours ) as were the times to 50% ( 11.73 hours ) and 80% ( 18.46 hours ) absorption compared with fasting ( 13.57 hours , 8.57 hours , and 14.07 hours , respectively ) .
The Uni-Dur 400-mg treatment resulted in a significantly higher maximum theophylline serum concentration ( 6.64 mu g  mL ) compared with the Uni-Dur 600-mg fasting treatment ( 5.33 mu g  mL ) ; however , the correlation between in vivo and in vitro data supports the bioequivalence of the two strengths .
This study shows that theophylline is slowly and consistently absorbed from the Uni-Dur 24-hour sustained-release form , and food or breaking the tablet does not alter the extent of absorption .
Thus Uni-Dur potentially provides greater ease of administration and convenience for patients while maintaining therapeutic theophylline serum levels over the 24-hour dosing interval .
