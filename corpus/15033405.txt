Side effects of the Yuzpe regimen of emergency contraception and two modifications .
We investigated side effects after the standard Yuzpe regimen or two modifications: substituting norethindrone as the progestin or eliminating the second dose .
We also examined the impact of taking either dose with food .
Nearly two thirds of women reported at least one side effect , the majority of which were mild or moderate .
Women in our study experienced more side effects after the second dose than after the first .
Taking the first dose within 1 h of a meal or snack was associated with increased nausea and vomiting ; taking the second dose within 1 h of a meal or snack was associated with decreased nausea and vomiting .
A targeted approach to prophylactic antiemetic use could reduce the number of women given these drugs , and the number who experience unnecessary side effects .
The impact of counseling on side effects should be further evaluated .
