Warfarin and its interactions with foods , herbs and other dietary supplements .
Despite its complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile , warfarin is still one of the most widely used oral anticoagulant agents .
Attaining optimal anticoagulation with this agent is clinically challenging in view of its many food and drug interactions .
Inappropriate anticoagulation control can expose patients to an increased risk of bleeding or thromboembolic complications , due to over and underanticoagulation , respectively .
Fluctuations in dietary vitamin K intake can have a significant effect on the degree of anticoagulation in patients treated with warfarin .
In addition , the explosion in use of various dietary supplements and herbal products can lead to undesired outcomes on anticoagulant levels .
The aim of this review is to discuss the scope and the potential clinical impact of the most commonly reported food , dietary supplement and herbal interactions with warfarin therapy .
Practical steps for patients and providers to minimise these interactions are highlighted .
