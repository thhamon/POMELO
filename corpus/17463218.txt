Effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of rifalazil , a novel antibacterial , in healthy male volunteers .
Rifalazil is a new antibiotic structurally related to rifampin but devoid of the metabolic liabilities typically associated with the rifamycin class of antibiotics .
A randomized , 3-way crossover study in healthy male volunteers ( n = 12 ) investigated the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single 25-mg oral rifalazil dose administered under a standard breakfast containing fat as 30% of calories , a high-fat breakfast containing fat as 60% of calories , and an overnight fast of 10 hours with a 21- to 28-day washout between doses .
Systemic exposure to rifalazil based on Cmax , AUC ( 0-Tlast ) , and AUC ( 0-infinity ) was increased progressively as the fat content of the test breakfast was increased from 30% to 60% compared with fasting .
The confidence intervals for both fat- fat-containing breakfasts are outside the limits of 80% to 125% allowed for food effect bioequivalence based on Cmax , AUC ( 0-Tlast ) , and AUC ( 0-infinity ) .
This food effect may be a result of increased fractional absorption with increasing dietary fat content .
Another striking finding was the large reduction of the pharmacokinetic intersubject variability after rifalazil administration with food .
Rifalazil was safe and well tolerated under fed and fasted conditions .
