Effects of diet and nutrition on drug therapy .
Foods containing biochemically active substances have been used therapeutically throughout the ages and continue to function as important adjuncts to drug therapy .
But naturally-occurring substances can also have adverse effects , as can the food additives of today .
Food Food- -drug interactions can alter the effect of therapeutic agents or cause adverse reactions where none had existed .
These problems are often aggravated in elderly patients , who may suffer from malnutrition ( e.g e.g. , protein insufficiency ) or altered food metabolism .
Malnutrition in the elderly can be caused by disease , socioeconomic factors , or simply by the deterioration of eating habits .
Although nutritional requirements decrease with age , the elderly still need nutrients for the repair of normal structures and for energy .
The nutritional needs of the elderly remain poorly defined .
Drugs can alter food metabolism , which , in turn , can affect drug action .
Many food food- -drug interactions are well documented ; drug absorption and drug elimination are often affected by an altered food metabolism .
Particular problems include salicylate- salicylate-induced iron deficiency , poor monitoring of vitamin metabolism and the effects of vitamin underuse and overuse , and lack of knowledge about the effects of long-term drug use on vitamin metabolism .
An additional problem is the presence of potentially harmful materials in non-prescription products .
