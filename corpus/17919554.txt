Interaction between warfarin and cranberry juice .
Warfarin is commonly used to treat or prevent thromboembolic events .
Cranberry juice has been suggested to have an interaction with warfarin .
However , there have been few reported cases of warfarin- cranberry juice interaction .
A 78-year-old , 86-kg man receiving warfarin at a total weekly dose of 45 mg for atrial fibrillation presented at the Bakersfield Healthcare Center of the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System with an international normalized ratio ( INR ) of 6.45 , having reported drinking a half gallon of cranberry  apple juice in the week prior to the elevated INR .
After discontinuation of the cranberry juice , maintaining the warfarin dose for 5 days , and resuming the warfarin at a total weekly dose of 40 mg , the INR returned to the therapeutic range of 2 to 3. .
Possible warfarin-cranberry juice interactions have been reported in the literature .
Case reports illustrate INR elevation associated with cranberry juice ingestion concomitantly with warfarin administration and may be associated with bleeding ( eg , pericardial , gastrointestinal ) .
In the present case report , cranberry juice was the most likely cause of the patient's elevated INR .
The Naranjo probability scale score was 3 , suggesting that there was a possible interaction between warfarin and cranberry juice , while the modified Naranjo scale score adapted for anticoagulants was 5 , rating the interaction as probable .
The combination of warfarin administration and cranberry juice ingestion appeared to be associated with an elevated INR without bleeding in this elderly patient .
