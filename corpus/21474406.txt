Oral anticoagulant treatment - evaluating the knowledge of patients admitted in physical medicine and rehabilitation units .
While numerous therapeutic education programs exist in physical medicine and rehabilitation ( PMsentandR ) , they rarely concern pharmacological treatments .
Nevertheless , drugs prescribed during a hospital stay can have a significant risk of adverse events .
Vitamin K antagonists ( VKA ) are among them .
To assess patients' knowledge on their oral anticoagulant treatment before their hospital discharge .
Fifty patients were enrolled in this prospective , monocenter study .
Their level of knowledge was assessed by a semi-structured interview between the pharmacist and the patients and  or their caregivers .
Seventy percent of patients were able to give the name of the drug they were taking , 82% could explain its effect and finally , 24% of patient knew their INR target values .
Twenty-two percent of patients were able to describe the symptoms in case of overdose and what to do in that case .
Forty percent of patients were aware of food interactions and 60% of self-medication risks .
The patient's knowledge and behavior acquired during their hospital stay are not enough to guarantee a safe treatment management upon discharge .
Based on this study , therapeutic patient education sessions were implemented .
These results suggest that specific drug therapy management sessions should be developed as part of PMsentandR's therapeutic education programs for patients .
