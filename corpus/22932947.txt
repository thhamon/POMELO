A novel formulation of L-thyroxine ( L-T4 ) reduces the problem of L-T4 malabsorption by coffee observed with traditional tablet formulations .
The purpose of this work is to evaluate if the coffee- coffee-associated malabsorption of tablet levothyroxine ( L-T4 ) is reduced by soft gel capsule .
We recruited 8 patients with coffee- coffee-associated L-T4 malabsorption including one hypothyroid patient .
For 6 months , the patients were switched to the capsule maintaining the L-T4 daily dose .
Patients took the capsule with water , having coffee 1 h later ( proper habit , PH ) on days 1-90 , or with coffee â¤ 5 min later ( improper habit , IH ) on days 91-180. .
After 6 months , 2 patients volunteered for an acute loading test of 600 Î¼g L-T4 ( capsule ) ingested with water ( PH ) or with coffee ( IH ) .
In the single hypothyroid patient , the post-switch TSH ranged 0.06-0.16 mU  L ( PH ) versus 5.8-22.4 mU  L pre-switch ( PH ) and 0.025-0.29 mU  L ( IH ) versus 26-34 mU  L pre-switch ( IH ) .
In the other 7 patients , post-switch TSH was 0.41 bigasentpleq 0.46 ( PH ) versus 0.28 bigasentpleq 0.20 pre-switch ( PH ) ( P = 0.61 ) and 0.34 bigasentpleq 0.30 ( IH ) versus 1.23 bigasentpleq 1.47 pre-switch ( IH ) ( P sentinf 0.001 ) .
Importantly , TSH levels in PH versus IH habit did not differ post-switch ( P = 0.90 ) , but they did pre-switch ( P sentinf 0.0001 ) .
The proportions of post-switch TSH levels sentinf0.10 mU  L with PH ( 33.3 % ) or with IH ( 33.3 % ) were borderline significantly greater than the corresponding pre-switch levels with PH ( 10.3 % ) ( P = 0.088 ) or with IH ( 0 % ) ( P = 0.0096 ) .
In the two volunteers , the L-T4 loading test showed that coffee influenced L-T4 pharmacokinetics minimally .
Soft gel capsules can be used in patients who are unable  unwilling to change their IH of taking L-T4. .
