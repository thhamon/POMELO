Effect of diallyl trisulfide on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine in rats .
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of diallyl trisulfide ( DATS ) , a major component derived from garlic , on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine .
Pharmacokinetic parameters of nifedipine were determined in rats following an oral gavage ( 3 mg  kg ) or intravenous administration ( 0.75 mg  kg ) of nifedipine with co-administration of DATS ( 20 mg  kg ) and long-term pretreatment of DATS ( 20 mg  kg  d for 15 consecutive days ) .
Compared to the control groups , higher C ( max ) and AUC ( 0-24 h ) were observed for oral gavage of nifedipine after short-term and long-term pretreatment of DATS , whereas those for intravenous nifedipine were little changed .
The oral bioavailabilities of nifedipine were remarkably enhanced via the concomitant use of DATS .
In conclusion , DATS increased the oral exposure of nifedipine in rats likely by the modification of intestinal metabolism of nifedipine , indicating that combined use of DATS or DATS-containing supplement with nifedipine may require caution because high plasma concentrations may lead to an undesired toxicity of this agent .
Practical Application: Patients suffering from cardiovascular disease should take caution in combined use of DATS or DATS-rich garlic supplement with nifedipine because long-term treatment of DATS could lead high plasma concentrations of nifedipine .
