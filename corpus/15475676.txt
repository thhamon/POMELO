The HIV Medication Self-Reported Nonadherence Reasons ( SNAR ) Index and its underlying psychological dimensions .
The purpose of this paper is to report on the construction of the HIV Medication Self-Reported Nonadherence Reasons ( SNAR ) index and its psychological correlates .
Data were derived from a sample of 193 Swedish HIV-seropositive women and men receiving antiretroviral medications .
Participants who reported dosing and  or scheduling and  or dietary instructions nonadherence in the past 7 days were presented with a modified AACTG list of 18 reasons for nonadherence .
From these data , two conceptually and statistically independent factors were obtained , which accounted for 39% of the variance in the data .
These factors were used as the basis for constructing two composite measures composing the SNAR index: the Medication concerns scale and the Routine disruption scale .
The Medication concerns scale correlated significantly to suboptimal dose and scheduling adherence and Routine disruption scale with poorer dietary instructions adherence .
Psychological distress was the best predictor of the SNAR index .
The SNAR index has a clearly interpretable factor structure that allows the derived scales to be useful as multi-item measures of self-reported reasons for nonadherence to HIV antiretroviral medications .
The psychological factors found to be associated with the index may imply a number of mental-health-related interventions to improve adherence , which deserve further exploration .
