[The significance of diet and associated factors in psoriasis] psoriasis]. .
Psoriasis is a T cell mediated inflammatory skin disease characterized by hyperproliferation and reduced differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes .
In severe cases , the disease can result in an insufficient nutritional status which may even be promoted by nutrient- nutrient-drug interactions .
Both the general diet and single food components have been suggested to play a role in etiology and pathogenesis of psoriasis .
Fasting periods , vegetarian diets , and diets rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish oil have all been associated with improvement in some studies .
The most likely explanation is the reduced amounts of arachidonic acid and the increased eicosapentaenoic acid intake resulting in a modulated eicosanoid profile .
However , only one of four controlled studies showed a benefit of omega-3 fatty acids compared to placebo .
Some psoriasis patients are gluten- gluten-sensitive and may benefit from a gluten free diet .
The active form of vitamin D exhibits anti-proliferative and immunoregulatory effects and has been shown to be useful in the treatment of psoriasis .
