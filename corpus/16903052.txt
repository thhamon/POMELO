Habitat selection by chironomid larvae: fast growth requires fast food .
1. .
Sediments have been considered as a habitat , a cover from predators and a source of food , but also as a source of potential toxic compounds .
Therefore , the choice of a suitable substrate is essential for the development of chironomids .
2. .
For the midge Chironomus riparius ( Meigen 1804 ) the growth rate of larvae has often been related to the food quality in sediments rather than to the amount of toxicants in the sediment .
Both food quality and sediment-bound toxicants have been reported to determine the field distribution of chironomid larvae .
3. .
We therefore studied the habitat selection by C. .
riparius larvae of floodplain lake sediments , differing in both food quality and concentrations of sediment-bound toxicants .
We offered the different sediments pairwise to the chironomid larvae in a choice experiment and their settlement in the paired sediments was determined after 10 days .
4. .
It was observed that larvae showed a clear preference for sediments with higher food quality , which also provided better growth conditions , and that the food quality overruled avoidance of the sediments with higher toxicant concentrations .
5. .
Our observations correspond with the persistence of this fast growing opportunistic chironomid species in organically enriched aquatic ecosystems independent of the contamination level .
