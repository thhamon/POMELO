Pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in a novel gastric-retentive extended-release formulation: comparison with an immediate-release formulation and effect of dose escalation and food .
The objectives of the 3 phase I studies described herein were ( 1 ) to compare the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin delivered from a novel gastric-retentive dosage form vs an immediate-release formulation , ( 2 ) to assess the dose proportionality of the gastric-retentive extended-release formulation , and ( 3 ) to determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin delivered from this formulation .
The time to reach maximum plasma concentration ( t ( max ) ) was extended for gabapentin delivered from the gastric-retentive extended-release formulation compared with the immediate-release formulation .
A dose-related increase in both the maximum plasma concentration ( C ( max ) ) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ) was observed as the gabapentin dose increased from 600 to 2400 mg .
Fed status and increased fat content delayed t ( max ) and enhanced C ( max ) and AUC in proportion to the fat content .
The pharmacokinetics of gabapentin delivered from this extended-release formulation allows a reduced dosing frequency while maintaining bioavailability and possibly diminishing the occurrence of adverse events attributable to a slower increase to the peak concentration compared with the immediate-release dosage form .
