Serum concentrations and clinical effects of atorvastatin in patients taking grapefruit juice daily .
To determine whether customary exposure to grapefruit juice ( GFJ ) alters serum concentrations , effectiveness , and potential adverse effects of atorvastatin in patients requiring the medication .
Patients receiving extended treatment with atorvastatin ( 10 , 20 or 40 mg day ( -1 ) ) at a stable dose received 300 ml day ( -1 ) of 100% GFJ for a period of 90 days .
One cohort of patients ( arm A , n= 60 ) continued on their current dose of atorvastatin ; the second cohort ( arm B , n= 70 ) reduced the daily dose by 50%. .
Serum atorvastatin , lipid profile , liver functions , and creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) were measured at baseline and at 30 , 60 , and 90 days after starting GFJ .
In Arm A patients , co-ingestion of GFJ significantly elevated serum atorvastatin by 19% to 26% compared with baseline .
Changes in lipid profile relative to baseline were negligible .
There were no adverse effects on liver function tests or CPK .
In arm B patients , serum atorvastatin declined by 12% to 25% compared to baseline , with a small but significant unfavourable effect in serum lipid profile .
There were no adverse effects on liver function tests or CPK .
In patients on extended stable atorvastatin treatment , addition of daily GFJ in typical quantities slightly elevates serum atorvastatin concentrations , but has no meaningful effect on the serum lipid profile , and causes no detectable adverse liver or muscle effects .
Reduction of atorvastatin dosage when moderate amounts of GFJ are co-ingested does not appear to be necessary .
