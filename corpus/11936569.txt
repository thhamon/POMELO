Is it really OK to take this with food ?
Old interactions with a new twist .
In response to consumers' increased interest in preventive health care , the food industry is producing a variety of foods fortified with calcium , iron , and other minerals and vitamins .
This well-meaning idea of food fortification is troubling in the context of clinical pharmacology .
The recommended Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) meal used in food- drug interaction studies is a high-fat , high-calorie meal with little nutritive value .
While some drugs may appear to be safe when taken with food , this may not be true when fortified foods are considered .
The mechanisms causing drug-fortified fortified food food interactions are the some well-known mechanisms that cause other drug-mineral interactions .
Certain drugs may exhibit decreased absorption due to chelation and adsorption .
Other drugs may have decreased absorption or increased excretion due to changes in gastric and  or urinary pH .
The results of such interactions may be clinically insignificant or severe , including treatment failure , frequent dose changes , antibiotic resistance , and increased morbidity and mortality .
Revisions of current regulatoryguidelines are necessary to take into account this potentially major source of " new " drug interactions .
