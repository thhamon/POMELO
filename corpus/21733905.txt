The effect of enteral nutrition supplements on serum voriconazole levels .
This is the case of a 13-year-old Hispanic boy ( 34.2 kg , 1.14 m ( 2 ) ) who had achieved stable therapeutic levels on voriconazole who later experienced levels reported as 'none detected' after the initiation of tube feeds .
This case outlines the temporal relationship of the effect of tube feeds on voriconazole serum levels .
Based on this information , voriconazole suspension should not be prescribed to patients also receiving supplemental enteral nutrition .
In absence of formal animal or human pharmacokinetic studies , it is the recommendation of the author to separate this combination and to be very vigilant about checking serum voriconazole levels in patients on voriconazole suspension and enteral nutrition supplements .
