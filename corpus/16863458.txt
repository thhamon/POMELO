Mycophenolate mofetil in organ transplantation: focus on metabolism , safety and tolerability .
Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) received its first approval for the prevention of renal allograft rejection in 1995 and has now become the most frequently used antiproliferative agent in maintenance immunosuppressive therapy for kidney , pancreas , liver and heart transplantation .
In addition , its use for the treatment of autoimmune diseases steadily increases .
This review focuses on the miscellaneous pharmacodynamic properties of the drug , its pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects , recipients of different organ transplants and combination therapy with other pharmaceuticals , as well as its safety profile .
The immunosuppressive activity of MMF is thought to derive mainly from the potent and selective inhibition of purine synthesis in both T and B lymphocytes .
In contrast to other immunosuppressants on the market , it is metabolised primarily by glucuronidation and lacks nephrotoxicity , cardiovascular toxicity or diabetogenic potential , thus making it a suitable candidate for combination regimens .
The most important side effects under MMF include gastrointestinal disorders , of which the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood , but seem to be complex and related to both effects of mycophenolic acid and its acyl glucuronide , as well as to decreased -immunity due to general immunosuppression after transplantation .
