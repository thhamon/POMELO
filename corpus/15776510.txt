By the way , doctor .
I recently started taking Lipitor for high cholesterol .
The label says: " Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice at any time while taking this medication .
" My doctor didn't warn me about grapefruit .
Several medically trained friends have never heard of such a thing .
I love grapefruit .
Is there really anything to worry about ?
