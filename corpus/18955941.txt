Monoamine oxidase inhibitors: a modern guide to an unrequited class of antidepressants .
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) currently have a " bad rap " and are thus infrequently used in psychopharmacology , even by experienced clinicians .
Misinformation about the dietary and drug interactions of MAOIs is widespread , whereas pragmatic tips for utilizing MAOIs to minimize risks and to maximize therapeutic actions are largely lacking in the contemporary literature .
While clearly not first-line treatments , MAOIs , in the hands of experienced and well-informed clinicians , can be a powerful therapeutic intervention for patients with depression , panic disorder , and other anxiety disorders who have failed first-line treatments .
This article focuses on the pharmacologic mechanisms of MAOIs , since an understanding of these mechanisms may provide a rationale to empower experts to expand their use of these agents .
Discussed here are not only the mechanisms of therapeutic action of MAOIs , but also the mechanisms explaining their side effects , including hypertensive interactions with dietary tyramine ( so-called " cheese reactions " ) and drug interactions that can lead to hypertensive reactions with some drugs and serotonin toxicities with others .
This article also provides practical tips on how to use MAOIs , including debunking certain myths and giving specific guidance about which foods and drugs to avoid .
Those with no previous interest in MAOIs may discover in this article a new " secret weapon " to add to their therapeutic armamentarium for patients who fail to respond to the better-known agents .
