The rational use of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals in clinical medicine .
The rational use of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals ( DS  N ) is based on objective evaluation of the clinical evidence as well as subjective evaluation of the risks , benefits , economic costs , and potential drug interactions .
Since the use of DS  N has skyrocketed , physicians must learn about them in order to better communicate with and care for their patients .
There are many evidence-based and rational uses for DS  N , but profiteering and quackery must be avoided at all costs .
