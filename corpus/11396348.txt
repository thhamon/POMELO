[Interactions of food and drug metabolism] metabolism]. .
The nutritional state , and  or the ingestion of specific nutrients , is  are able to modify drug disposition , by interfering with drug absorption , distribution , storage , and metabolism .
Recent data report that nutrients interfere with drug metabolism either by modifying key enzymes of phase I ( cytochromeP450 dependent mixed function oxidase ) and II ( glucuronosyl , sulfonyl- . . .
transferases ) , or by modulating coenzymes availability ( NADPH , UDPglucuronic acid.. acid... ) .
Food components involved in drug metabolism modifications are either macro-nutrients ( carbohydrates , lipids , proteins , ethanol ) , micronutriments ( vitamins , minerals ) , or phytochemicals .
Drug-nutrients interactions may be beneficials , and thus could constitute , i.e i.e. a way to improve drug therapeutic index , or generate adverse effects .
