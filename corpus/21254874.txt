The effect of grapefruit juice on drug disposition .
Since their initial discovery in 1989 , grapefruit juice ( GFJ ) -drug interactions have received extensive interest from the scientific , medical , regulatory and lay communities .
Although knowledge regarding the effects of GFJ on drug disposition continues to expand , the list of drugs studied in the clinical setting remains relatively limited .
This article reviews the in vitro effects of GFJ and its constituents on the activity of CYP enzymes , organic anion- anion-transporting polypeptides ( OATPs ) , P-glycoprotein , esterases and sulfotransferases .
The translational applicability of the in vitro findings to the clinical setting is discussed for each drug metabolizing enzyme and transporter .
Reported AUC ratios for available GFJ-drug drug interaction studies are also provided .
Relevant investigations were identified by searching the PubMed electronic database from 1989 to 2010. .
GFJ increases the bioavailability of some orally administered drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A and normally undergo extensive presystemic extraction .
In addition , GFJ can decrease the oral absorption of a few drugs that rely on OATPs in the gastrointestinal tract for their uptake .
The number of drugs shown to interact with GFJ in vitro is far greater than the number of clinically relevant GFJ-drug interactions .
For the majority of patients , complete avoidance of GFJ is unwarranted .
