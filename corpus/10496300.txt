Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and pharmacodynamics of artemether-lumefantrine .
The combination of artemether and lumefantrine ( benflumetol ) is a new and very well tolerated oral antimalarial drug effective even against multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria .
The artemether component is absorbed rapidly and biotransformed to dihydroartemisinin , and both are eliminated with terminal half-lives of around 1 hour .
These are very active antimalarials which give a rapid reduction in parasite biomass and consequent rapid resolution of symptoms .
The lumefantrine component is absorbed variably in malaria , and is eliminated more slowly ( half-life of 3 to 6 days ) .
Absorption is very dependent on coadministration with fat , and so improves markedly with recovery from malaria .
Thus artemether clears most of the infection , and the lumefantrine concentrations that remain at the end of the 3- to 5-day treatment course are responsible for eliminating the residual 100 to 10 000 parasites .
The area under the curve of plasma lumefantrine concentrations versus time , or its correlate the plasma concentration on day 7. .
has proved an important determinant of therapeutic response .
Characterisation of these pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships provided the basis for dosage optimisation , an approach that could be applied to other antimalarial drugs .
