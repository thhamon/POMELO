Effects of widely used drugs on micronutrients: a story rarely told .
Vitamins and trace elements are essential to the body , however , deficiencies are frequently observed in the general population .
Diet is mostly responsible for these deficiencies but drugs also may play a significant role by influencing their metabolism .
These effects are rarely assessed in clinical practice , in part because of limited data available in the literature .
Drug-induced micronutrient depletions , however , may be the origin of otherwise unexplained symptoms that might sometimes influence medication compliance .
We present various examples of widely prescribed drugs that can precipitate micronutrient deficiencies .
This review aims at sensitizing physicians on drug-micronutrient interactions .
High-risk population groups also are presented and supplementation protocols are suggested .
