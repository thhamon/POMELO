A randomized , rater-blinded , crossover study comparing the clinical efficacy of Ritalin ( bigasentr ) LA ( methylphenidate ) treatment in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder under different breakfast conditions over 2 weeks .
Several extended-release methylphenidate medications are available for treatment of children with ADHD .
Pharmacokinetic investigations suggest that the serum levels of methylphenidate are partially altered when the medication is taken without breakfast .
Clinical data comparing different breakfast situations are missing .
In this study , different breakfast compositions and their influence on treatment with Ritalin LA are investigated .
A total of 150 patients were enrolled in a rater-blinded , randomized crossover trial that compared a minimal breakfast with a standard breakfast in patients under stable treatment with Ritalin LA .
Ratings for clinical efficacy were carried out after 1 week by teachers and parents ( FBB-ADHS ) , as well as physicians ( CGI ) .
Additionally , a math test was administered to the patients .
Of the total patients , 144 finished the trial with a breakfast compliance of 93%. .
All of the clinical rating scales showed consistently no difference between the two breakfast conditions .
Non-inferiority of minimal breakfast versus standard breakfast was shown to be statistically significant ( FBB-AHDS ( Teacher ) : 0.97 with minimal breakfast , 1.01 with standard breakfast , P sentinf 0.0001 ) .
The clinical efficacy of Ritalin LA is not influenced by breakfast and works independently of food intake .
