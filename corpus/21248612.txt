Pharmacokinetic studies in women of 2 novel oral formulations of tranexamic acid therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding .
Two randomized , open-label clinical studies involving healthy female volunteers aged 18-45 years ( study 1 , N = 32 ; study 2 , N = 40 ) are described , which characterize the pharmacokinetics and steady-state dosage regimen performance of 2 novel , modified-release tranexamic acid tablet formulations .
The objective of these studies was to identify the optimum product formulation to advance into late-phase clinical trials for heavy menstrual bleeding .
For study 1 , participants received single 1.3-g doses ( 2 650-mg tablets ) of tranexamic acid modified-immediate-release ( MIR ) and tranexamic acid delayed-release ( DR ) formulations under fasting conditions compared with nonfasting conditions ( after breakfast ) .
For study 2 , participants received tranexamic acid MIR or tranexamic acid DR as a single 1.3-g dose followed by a dosage regimen of 1.3 g every 8 hours for 5 days .
Plasma tranexamic acid concentrations reached minimum effective levels ( ≥5 μg  mL ) within 1.5 hours and within 3 hours after a 1.3-g tranexamic acid MIR and tranexamic acid DR dose , respectively .
Food did not appreciably influence tranexamic acid MIR pharmacokinetics , whereas a high-fat meal significantly lowered the maximum concentration produced with tranexamic acid DR .
Peak systemic exposure and maintenance of plasma tranexamic acid concentrations within the therapeutic range ( 5-15 μg  mL ) were optimally achieved with 1.3 g of the MIR formulation dosed every 8 hours .
The MIR and DR formulations were well tolerated .
Peak-to-trough steady-state performance of the tranexamic acid MIR 1.3-g product ( dosed every 8 hours , or 3 times daily , for up to 5 days ) supported its advancement to late-phase clinical trials in women with heavy menstrual bleeding .
