Nonvitamin , nonmineral dietary supplementation in HIV-positive people .
Many consumers with chronic diseases attempt to take control of their health by using dietary supplements .
The objective of this study was to describe current nonvitamin , nonmineral ( NVNM ) supplement use of HIV-infected persons in the Nutrition for Healthy Living ( NFHL ) cohort , the financial burden that buying these supplements might pose to this population , and to review current literature on potential interactions between NVNM supplements .
At baseline visit , participants were educated by a registered dietitian on keeping a complete 3-day food record ( including all supplements ) for 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day .
Seventy-two subjects reported consumption of NVNM supplements , and their food records were reviewed in detail .
Each of the 72 subjects in this study used a mean of 6 NVNM supplements , which may have been in the form of a pill , powder , bar , or liquid .
The 6 most common were glutamine ( 51% ) , N-acetyl-cysteine ( 36% ) , fish oil ( 33% ) , alpha-lipoic acid ( 32% ) , acetyl-l-carnitine ( 28% ) , and coenzyme Q10 ( 28% ) .
Participants were also taking an average of 4 vitamin  mineral supplements ; the 6 most common were multivitamin  multimineral ( 83% ) , vitamin E ( 51% ) , vitamin C ( 47% ) , vitamin B complex ( 43% ) , calcium ( 29% ) , and selenium ( 28% ) .
With a total of 107 different types of NVNM supplements , our estimated cost examples indicated a weekly supplement regimen cost of between sentdol25 and sentdol40 dollars .
According to literature review , taking an NVNM supplement may involve some risk because many components have not been studied and these products are not tightly regulated .
