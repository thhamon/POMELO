The monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor rasagiline in the treatment of Parkinson disease: is tyramine a challenge ?
Rasagiline is an irreversible monoamine oxidase type B ( MAO-B ) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson disease as initial monotherapy and as adjunct therapy to levodopa .
Pharmacologic inhibition of monoamine oxidase type A ( MAO-A ) , but not MAO-B , poses a risk of the " cheese effect , " a hypertensive response to excess dietary tyramine , a biogenic sympathomimetic amine .
Tyramine challenge studies , conducted to characterize rasagiline selectivity for the MAO-B enzyme and tyramine sensitivity , demonstrate that rasagiline , when used at the recommended dose , is selective for MAO-B and is not associated with heightened tyramine sensitivity .
This conclusion is also supported by safety results from large clinical trials of rasagiline in Parkinson disease involving 2066 rasagiline- rasagiline-treated patients who did not require dietary tyramine restriction per protocol .
In late 2009 , US labeling for rasagiline was modified to state that dietary tyramine restrictions are not ordinarily required when rasagiline is administered at recommended doses .
In addition , because rasagiline has been demonstrated to be selective for MAO-B at the approved dose of up to 1 mg  d , contraindications regarding concomitant use with sympathomimetic amines , use of sympathomimetic vasopressors in conjunction with general or local anesthesia , and use in patients with pheochromocytoma also were removed .
