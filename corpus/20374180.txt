Effects of ingestion of grapefruit juice or grapefruit on the hypotensive effect and plasma concentrations of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists ( amlodipine and nifedipine ) : a case study .
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ingestion of grapefruit juice or grapefruit on the hypotensive effect and plasma concentration of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists , i.e i.e. , amlodipine and nifedipine .
A 50-year-old man with essential hypertension was studied .
Grapefruit juice ( 500 ml ) was taken together with the antihypertensive drug , while one grapefruit was taken before drug ingestion .
Blood pressures were measured using a digital automatic blood pressure monitor over a certain period .
A single ingestion of grapefruit juice had no effect on plasma amlodipine concentration , but rapidly increased plasma nifedipine concentration and decreased blood pressure , while the effect on blood pressure was short-lasting .
Grapefruit had no effect on either drug .
It should be of concern that ingestion of a relatively large volume of grapefruit juice causes rapid decrease in blood pressure when the subject is treated by nifedipine .
