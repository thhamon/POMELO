[A patient with lessened sensitivity to acenocoumarol during a period of enteral feeding]. .
A 69-year-old man was operated on for a subdural haematoma which had developed during the use of acenocoumarol .
Directly after the operation the patient was started on enteral feeding .
The acenocoumarol was restarted at a later stage .
The dose of acenocoumarol needed for an appropriate level of blood-dilution was twice as high during the period of enteral feeding than it had been preoperatively .
After the transition from enteral feeding to oral feeding it was possible to lower the dose of acenocoumarol .
The need for a higher dose was probably due to enhanced binding of the proteins in the enteral feeding .
The patient was admitted to a nursing home .
The combination of acenocoumarol and enteral feeding occurs frequently in patients being rehabilitated .
It is important to monitor the blood-dilution when starting and stopping enteral feeding .
