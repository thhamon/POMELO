Clinical development of metformin extended-release tablets for type 2 diabetes diabetes: an overview .
Glumetz ( Depomed , Inc. .
, Menlo Park , CA , USA ) is a recently approved gastric retentive extended-release formulation of metformin ( M-ER ) that provides effective , sustained and well-tolerated glycemic control with once daily administration .
Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated a similar bioavailability of M-ER administered once daily to immediate-release metformin given twice daily .
In addition , M-ER has demonstrated a nearly linear dose proportionality with a relative bioavailability of highest dose to lowest dose of 80% , whereas with immediate-release metformin the relative bioavailability of the highest dose to the lowest dose is only 58%. .
M-ER demonstrated a positive food effect and should be administered with a meal , preferably the evening meal .
Because metformin is only eliminated through renal mechanisms , the use of M-ER , as is the case with other formulations , is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment .
Administration of M-ER with sulfonylureas ( SUs ) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin .
In controlled clinical trials M-ER demonstrated efficacy for 24 weeks as a monotherapy or in combination with SU .
Additionally , glycemic control was maintained for an extra 24 weeks in an open-label monotherapy extension study of M-ER .
M-ER was well tolerated in all studies .
