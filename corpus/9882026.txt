Review article: olestra and its gastrointestinal safety .
Olestra is a fat substitute made from sucrose and vegetable oil .
Olestra is neither digested nor absorbed , and therefore adds no calories or fat to the diet .
Because the gut is the only organ that is exposed to olestra , the potential for olestra to affect gastrointestinal structure and function , and the absorption of nutrients from the gut , has been investigated .
Histological evaluations performed after long-term feeding studies have shown no indications that olestra causes injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa .
Olestra is not metabolized by the colonic microflora , and has no meaningful effects on the metabolic function of these organisms .
Studies of gastrointestinal transit have shown that the consumption of olestra with food does not affect gastric emptying , or small or large bowel transit times .
Olestra does not affect the absorption of macronutrients , water- water-soluble vitamins or minerals .
It causes a dose-responsive decrease in the availability of the fat-soluble vitamins vitamins A , D , E and K ; however , this potentially adverse effect is offset by the addition of vitamins to olestra- olestra-containing foods .
Olestra has no consistent effect on the amount of total bile acids excreted in the faeces , and therefore probably has no significant effect on bile acid absorption .
The occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms , including diarrhoea , loose stools , gas and abdominal cramping , after consumption of olestra under ordinary snacking conditions is comparable to that following consumption of triglyceride- triglyceride-containing snacks .
