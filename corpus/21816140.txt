Functional foods and dietary supplements supplements: products at the interface between pharma and nutrition .
It is increasingly recognized that most chronic diseases of concern today are multifactorial in origin .
To combat such diseases and adverse health conditions , a treatment approach where medicines and nutrition complement each other may prove to be the most successful .
Within nutrition , apart from ( disease-related ) dietetic regimes , an increasing number of functional foods and dietary supplements , each with their own health claim , are marketed .
These food items are considered to be positioned between traditional foods and medicines at the so-called 'Pharma-Nutrition Interface' .
This paper encompasses aspects related to the regulatory framework and health claims of functional foods and dietary supplements .
The use of functional foods or dietary supplements may offer opportunities to reduce health risk factors and risk of diseases , both as monotherapy and in combination with prescription drugs .
Nevertheless , the potential caveats of these products should not be overlooked .
These caveats include the increased risk for food-drug interactions due to the elevated amounts of specific functional ingredients in the diet , and the stimulation of self-medication potentially resulting in lower adherence to drug therapy .
Health technology assessments should be used more to compare the cost-effectiveness and benefit-risk ratios of drugs , functional foods and dietary supplements , and to evaluate the added value of functional foods or dietary supplements to drug therapy .
