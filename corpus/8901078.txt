Differential effects of food on the bioavailability of controlled-release oxycodone tablets and immediate-release oxycodone solution .
The effects of a high-fat meal on the bioavailability of oxycodone hydrochloride , administered as a recently developed 40 mg controlled-release ( CR ) tablet or a 20 mg immediate-release ( IR ) solution , were evaluated in a randomized crossover study in 22 normal male and female subjects .
Serial blood samples were collected for 36 h after dosing and analyzed for oxycodone by a validated method using gas chromatography  mass spectrometry .
There was no significant food effect with CR oxycodone as judged by 90% confidence interval ( CI ) analysis of AUC0-infinity and Cmax values under fed and fasted conditions .
For the IR solution , both oxycodone bioavailability and peak plasma oxycodone concentration were significantly altered by consumption of the high-fat meal , with the mean value for AUC0-infinity increasing to 120% ( CI = 109-132% ) and the mean value for Cmax decreasing to 82% ( CI = 47-91% ) of values observed in the fasted condition .
Adverse events reported for both formulations were mostly mild to moderate in severity and typical of those observed with opioids .
