Influence of body weight and type of chow on the sensitivity of rats to the behavioral effects of the direct-acting dopamine-receptor agonist quinpirole .
Amount and type of food can alter dopamine systems and sensitivity to drugs acting on those systems .
This study examined whether changes in body weight , food type , or both body weight and food type contribute to these effects .
Rats had free or restricted access ( increasing , decreasing , or maintaining body weight ) to standard ( 5.7% fat ) or high-fat ( 34.3% ) chow .
In rats gaining weight with restricted or free access to high-fat chow , both limbs of the quinpirole yawning dose-response curve ( 0.0032-0.32 mg  kg ) shifted leftward compared with rats eating standard chow .
Restricting access to standard or high-fat chow ( maintaining or decreasing body weight ) decreased or eliminated quinpirole-induced yawning ; within 1 week of resuming free feeding , sensitivity to quinpirole was restored , although the descending limb of the dose-response curve was shifted leftward in rats eating high-fat chow .
These are not likely pharmacokinetic differences because quinpirole-induced hypothermia was not different among groups .
PG01037 and L-741 , 626 antagonized the ascending and descending limbs of the quinpirole dose-response curve in rats eating high-fat chow , indicating D3 and D2 receptor mediation , respectively .
Rats eating high-fat chow also developed insulin resistance .
These results show that amount and type of chow alter sensitivity to a direct-acting dopamine-receptor agonist with the impact of each factor depending on whether body weight increases , decreases , or is maintained .
These data demonstrate that feeding conditions , perhaps related to insulin and insulin sensitivity , profoundly impact the actions of drugs acting on dopamine systems .
