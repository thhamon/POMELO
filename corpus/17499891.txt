Environmental lead toxicity and nutritional factors .
Environmental lead toxicity is an old but persistent public health problem throughout the world and children are more susceptible to lead than adults because of their hand to mouth activity , increased respiratory rates and higher gastrointestinal absorption per unit body weight .
In the last decade children's blood lead levels have fallen significantly in a number of countries .
Despite this reduction , childhood lead toxicity continues to be a major public health problem for certain at-risk groups of children , and concern remains over the effects of lead on intellectual development .
The currently approved clinical intervention method is to give chelating agents , which bind and removed lead from lead burdened tissues .
Studies indicate , however , that there is a lack of safety and efficacy when conventional chelating agents are used .
Several studies are underway to determine the beneficial effect of nutrients supplementation following exposure to lead .
Data suggest that nutrients may play an important role in abating some toxic effects of lead .
To explain the importance of using exogenous nutrients in treating environmental lead toxicity the following topics are addressed: ( i ) different sources of lead exposure  current blood lead levels and ( ii ) protective effects of nutrients supplementation ( some essential elements and vitamins ) in lead toxicity .
