Phenelzine- Phenelzine-induced myocardial injury: a case report .
Phenelzine is an irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) .
Hypertensive reactions after ingestion of tyramine- tyramine-rich foods such as cheese are well known .
However , a review of the available medical literature found no previous reports of myocardial infarction resulting from the ingestion of cheese by a patient taking a MAOI .
A 34-year-old female taking phenelzine for depression developed severe chest pain 1 h after eating cheese .
She was hypertensive and the electrocardiography showed ischemic changes in the antero-lateral chest leads .
The chest pain and elevated blood pressure were relieved with intravenous morphine and nitroprusside .
The initial serum troponin I level was normal , but serial repeat levels showed a rising trend with a peak at 4.89 ug  L ( reference range sentinf0.05 ug  L ) 6 h after the initial blood draw , suggestive of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction .
The patient subsequently developed hypotension 4 h after another therapeutic dose of phenelzine was served to the patient 4 h after her admission to the ED .
This was corrected with at least 2 L of intravenous normal saline boluses .
Subsequent EKGs and Sestamibi scan showed no evidence of cardiac ischemia .
She was discharged home after a hospital stay of 3 days .
We believe this to be the first reported case of myocardial infarction resulting from ingestion of cheese in a patient taking a MAOI .
It might be expected that hypertensive crisis could lead to a myocardial infarction , but a review of the medical literature found no such cases reported .
