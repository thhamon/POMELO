Patients receiving parenteral nutrition ( PN ) usually have conditions that require intravenous ( IV ) medications .
Antibiotics , and cardiovascular , gastrointestinal and electrolyte agents are commonly prescribed for these patients .

This article will describe the physico-chemical characteristics of PN and concepts used in dealing with issues of drug and nutrient interactions that occur in patients requiring PN .
