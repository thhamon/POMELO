Drug-nutrient interactions interactions: a broad view with implications for practice .
The relevance of drug ?
nutrient interactions in daily practice continues to grow with the widespread use of medication .
Interactions can involve a single nutrient , multiple nutrients , food in general , or nutrition status .
Mechanistically , drug ?
nutrient interactions occur because of altered intestinal transport and metabolism , or systemic distribution , metabolism and excretion , as well as additive or antagonistic effects .
Optimal patient care includes identifying , evaluating , and managing these interactions .
This task can be supported by a systematic approach for categorizing interactions and rating their clinical significance .
This review provides such a broad framework using recent examples , as well as some classic drug ?
nutrient interactions .
Pertinent definitions are presented , as is a suggested approach for clinicians .
This important and expanding subject will benefit tremendously from further clinician involvement .
