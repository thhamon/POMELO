The behavioral pharmacology of anorexigenic drugs in nonhuman primates: 30 years of progress .
Comparatively few studies over the past 30 years have used pharmacological manipulations as a means of understanding processes underlying feeding behavior of nonhuman primates .
In the 1970s and early 1980s , four laboratories provided data on the anorexigenic effects of a range of drugs on rhesus monkeys and baboons , and a fifth laboratory studied the effects of neuropeptides on feeding behavior of baboons .
There were differences in the way anorexigenic drugs altered eating topography , and those that increased dopamine levels had greater abuse liability than those that increased serotonin levels .
Studies in the 1980s and 1990s used foraging models and principles of behavioral economics to understand food- food-drug interactions .
Experimenter-given anorexigenic drugs did not function as economic substitutes for food .
Recent studies have examined the effects of a range of drugs on consumption of highly palatable food and model diet- diet-induced obesity .
Although some drugs , including stimulants , N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists , and a cannabinoid antagonist increased the latency to standard food consumption , there was little evidence for a selective effect of any drug on highly palatable food consumption .
Results obtained in nonhuman primates did not always confirm those observed in rodents .
Future studies looking at sex differences and social factors may provide insight into factors related to human obesity .
