Cigarette smoking , coffee drinking , and ingestion of charcoal-broiled beef as potential modifiers of drug therapy and confounders of clinical trials .
A pathway of research is described , leading from the finding of an inhibitory effect of 3-methylcholanthrene on the carcinogenicity of an aminoazo dye , to the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes by 3-methylcholanthrene , benzo[a] benzo[a]pyrene , and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , to the demonstration of enhanced drug metabolism in cigarette smokers , coffee drinkers , and people who eat charcoal-broiled beef .
The results of these studies indicate that cigarette smoking , coffee drinking , and the ingestion of charcoal-broiled beef ( all resulting in exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) can influence the dosing regimen needed for proper drug therapy and are potential confounders of clinical trials with drugs metabolized by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible enzymes .
