[Clinico-immunological study of 16 cases of benzoate intolerance in children]. .
The authors report a sery of 16 cases of intolerance to the benzoates in children .
Sixteen children ( 9 boys and 7 girls ) were directed to the Hospital of Tarbes from June 1995 to July 1995 , for recurring urticaria ( 7  16 ) combined with asthma ( 1  16 ) , atopic eczema ( 2  16 ) , dermorespiratory syndrome ( 2  16 ) and asthma ( 1  16 ) .
All were subject to an immunological examination comprising alimentation inquiry , prick test , IgE determination , RAST , oral provocation test to benzoates , which establishes the diagnosis , whose confirmation is certified by the benefit of the food eviction .
To conclusion , the authors underline several points: the presumable underestimation of the intolerance , the often mentioned atopic familial context , the observed pathology ( urticaria , asthma , eczema ) , the importance of the provocation test .
Finally , besides food such as grey shrimps , sodas and antibiotic syrups , one finds benzoates in the antiallergic syrups initially prescribed as a preventive measure .
