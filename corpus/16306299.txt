Enteral nutrition and drug administration , interactions , and complications .
The enteral route has become the standard of care to deliver nutrition support for hospitalized acute care and ambulatory care patients .
The same access device is increasingly being used to deliver medications , which provides cost savings but also creates new challenges .
Cost savings can be negated if the concomitant administration of nutrition elicits a decrease in bioavailability due to incompatibilities that alter drug or nutrition therapy .
Feeding tubes can deliver nutrients and drugs to the stomach , small bowel , or both , with optimal efficacy of medications depending on delivery to the appropriate segment of the gastrointestinal tract .
Liquid preparations are often the preferred formulation for enteral administration .
Obstruction of the enteral access device may occur when specialized medication formulations are altered inappropriately .
Occasionally , the enteral formula should be changed to modify the content of free water , fiber , electrolytes , or vitamins that may interfere with the drug therapy .
Intolerance to enteral nutrition such as abdominal distention and diarrhea may be the result of the medication , and the causative agent should be identified to improve patient comfort .
This article will address optimal drug delivery via enteral access devices and possible complications associated with therapy .
