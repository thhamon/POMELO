[Extensive mesenteric ischemia related to naratriptan overuse associated with grapefruit juice absorption]. .
We reported the case of a 61-year-old woman , who has been hospitalized in ICU because of an extensive mesenteric ischaemia , involving the small bowel , secondary to a naratriptan overuse .
This mesenteric ischaemia was complicated by multiple organ failure and was responsible for extensive small bowel resection and left colectomy .
A concomitant abundant absorption of grapefruit juice , a well-known P450 inhibitor , may have enhanced this naratriptan toxicity .
This case underscore that an abdominal pain occurring in the context of headache treatment may be related to a mesenteric ischaemia .
