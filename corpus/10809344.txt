Consumer use of St St. .
John's wort: a survey on effectiveness , safety , and tolerability .
Despite its poorly described pharmacology , effectiveness , and safety , use of St St. .
John's wort ( SJW ) is largely unsupervised and unexplored , and can potentially lead to adverse outcomes .
We conducted a telephone survey of 43 subjects who had taken SJW to assess demographics , psychiatric and medical conditions , dosage , duration of use , reason for use , side effects , concomitant drugs , professional consultation , effectiveness , relapse , and withdrawal effects .
Most subjects reported taking SJW for depression , and 74% did not seek medical advice .
Mean dosage was 475.6+  -360 mg  day ( range 300-1200 mg  day ) and mean duration of therapy was 7.3+  -10.1 weeks ( range 1 day-5 yrs ) .
Among 36 ( 84% ) reporting improvement , 18 ( 50% ) had a psychiatric diagnosis .
Twenty ( 47% ) reported side effects , resulting in discontinuation in five ( 12% ) and one emergency room visit .
Two consumers experienced symptoms of serotonin syndrome and three reported food-drug interactions .
Thirteen consumers experienced withdrawal symptoms and two had a depressive relapse .
These data suggest the need for greater consumer and provider awareness of the potential risks of SJW in self-care of depression and related syndromes .
