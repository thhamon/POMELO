Principles of clinical pharmacology in postexposure prophylaxis .
Deciding on postexposure prophylaxis for any infection requires that the patient and healthcare provider understand the magnitude of infection risk and the adverse consequences of therapeutic intervention or nonintervention .
Principles of epidemiology and microbiology allow us to estimate the risk of infection .
Principles of clinical pharmacology allow us to estimate the risk and benefit of therapy .
The dose-response-time relationships for antiviral activity and toxicity of a drug can be used to develop regimens that maximize benefit and minimize risk .
Other important pharmacologic considerations include the role of active and toxic drug metabolites , combination chemotherapy , drug interactions , and medication compliance .
