Prevalence of concomitant use of alcohol and sedative-hypnotic drugs in middle and older aged persons: a systematic review .
To systematically review the prevalence of concomitant alcohol and sedative-hypnotic use among middle-aged and older persons .
A bibliographic search of English-language literature was performed using MEDLINE , EMBASE , and PsycINFO ( January 1990-August 2012 ) .
The reference lists of all included articles were screened for additional relevant articles not identified by any of the bibliographic searches .
Population-based studies in which the mean age of participants was 40 years or older were included .
For a study to be included in the review , alcohol use had to be reported in terms of the quantity or frequency consumed .
Data from included articles were extracted using a standardized data extraction tool .
Five population-based studies conducted in North America , 10 in Europe , and 1 in Australia were included in the review .
Up to 88% of men and 79% of women who used sedative-hypnotics also consumed alcohol .
Up to 28% of those who consumed alcohol were concomitant users of sedative-hypnotics .
Alcohol was consumed at higher levels among middle-aged than older persons .
Risky drinking ( eg , binge drinking , heavy drinking ) was more prevalent among middle-aged than older persons .
In contrast , sedative-hypnotic use was more prevalent among older persons .
Our review identified a higher prevalence of alcohol consumption among middle-aged than older persons .
However , middle-aged persons may experience harm from alcohol  sedative-hypnotic drug interactions due to risky drinking behavior .
Despite lower levels of alcohol consumption , older persons may be more susceptible to addictive central nervous system effects than younger persons because of physiologic changes in psychotropic drug and alcohol metabolism .
Clinicians should consider patients' alcohol consumption patterns before prescribing sedative-hypnotic drugs .
