Fatal haemopericardium and gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to possible interaction of cranberry juice with warfarin .
We report a case of fatal internal haemorrhage in an elderly man who consumed only cranberry juice for two weeks while maintaining his usual dosage of warfarin .
We propose that naturally occurring compounds such as flavonoids , which are present in fruit juices , may increase the potency of warfarin by competing for the enzymes that normally inactivate warfarin .
While traditionally regarded as foodstuffs , consumption of fruit juices should be considered when patients develop adverse drug reactions .
