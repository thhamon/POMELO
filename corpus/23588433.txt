Interactions between antihypertensive drugs and food .
A drug interaction is defined as any alteration , pharmacokinetics and  or pharmacodynamics , produced by different substances , other drug treatments , dietary factors and habits such as drinking and smoking .
These interactions can affect the antihypertensive drugs , altering their therapeutic efficacy and causing toxic effects .
The aim of this study was to conduct a review of available data about interactions between antihypertensive agents and food .
The purpose of this review was to report an update of main findings with respect to the interactions between food and antihypertensive drugs by way of a search conducted in PubMed , which yielded a total of 236 articles initially .
After excluding different articles , which were not focusing on the specific objective , the main results refer to interactions between antihypertensive drugs and food ( in general ) as well as between antihypertensive agents and grapefruit juice .
Food may affect the bioavailability of antihypertensive drugs and this should be carefully considered .
Advising patients to remove the grapefruit juice from their diet when treatment with these drugs seems to be the best recommendation .
Given these interactions and the associated potential adverse effects the anamnesis must include detailed information about the specific eating habits of the patients .
