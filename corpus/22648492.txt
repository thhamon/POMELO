New anticoagulants in the treatment of VTE .
Low molecular weight heparins ( LMWHs ) and vitamin K antagonists make up the cornerstone of therapy for patients with venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) but have drawbacks making their use difficult in daily practice .
Current research focuses on the development of new anticoagulant drugs that could be administered orally at a fixed dose , with fewer food and drug interactions and no need for monitoring or dose adjustment .
Several new drugs are tested in noninferiority trials , either as a single-drug approach treatment ( e.g e.g. , rivaroxaban or apixaban ) , or after an initial course of LMWH ( e.g e.g. , dabigatran or edoxaban ) .
Published clinical trials demonstrate that rivaroxaban and dabigatran are noninferior to conventional treatment in patients with VTE .
Several issues remain challenging for physicians , such as the lack of antidote and of routinely available monitoring tests .
To what extent new anticoagulant drugs will change clinical practice is not yet well defined .
They may facilitate outpatient management of VTE .
They might also improve the risk-benefit balance of prolonged anticoagulation and therefore modify the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients .
