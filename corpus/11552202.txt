Warfarin resistance and enteral feedings: 2 case reports and a supporting in vitro study .
This study investigated whether an interaction between common enteral feeding products and warfarin exists .
Two clinical cases of apparent interaction spurred a supporting in vitro study .
Both the clinical cases and the in vitro study showed that several enteral feeding products bind warfarin , reducing the bioavailability of the drug .
The binding appears to occur between warfarin and the protein component of the feeding product .
This clinically important interaction is likely when warfarin and enteral feeding products are used concurrently .
Clinicians should be aware of this potential interaction and monitor the therapy closely , particularly when enteral feeding is discontinued .
