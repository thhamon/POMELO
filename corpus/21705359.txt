Nutrition in cardiovascular disease disease: salt in hypertension and heart failure .
There is much evidence for a causal relationship between salt intake and blood pressure ( BP ) .
The current salt intake in many countries is between 9 and 12 g  day .
A reduction in salt intake to the recommended level of 5-6 g  day lowers BP in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals .
A further reduction to 3-4 g  day has a much greater effect .
Prospective studies and outcome trials have demonstrated that a lower salt intake is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease .
Increasing evidence also suggests that a high salt intake is directly related to left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) independent of BP .
Both raised BP and LVH are important risk factors for heart failure .
It is therefore possible that a lower salt intake could prevent the development of heart failure .
In patients who already have heart failure , a high salt intake aggravates the retention of salt and water , thereby exacerbating heart failure symptoms and progression of the disease .
A lower salt intake plays an important role in the management of heart failure .
Despite this , currently there is no clear evidence on how far salt intake should be reduced in heart failure .
Our personal view is that these patients should reduce their salt intake to sentinf5 g  day , i.e i.e. the maximum intake recommended by the World Health Organisation for all adults .
If salt intake is successfully reduced , there may well be a need for a reduction in diuretic dosage .
