[Norwegian cancer patients and the health food market- -what is used and why ?
] .
There is limited knowledge about patients' use of herbs and dietary supplements .
In the current project we have studied this in Norwegian patients , also their sources of information , beliefs and attitudes .
A structured questionnaire was filled in anonymously by 149 patients ( response rate 64% ) with common cancer diagnoses .
Of the patients , 56% used herbs and dietary supplements ( average: 2.0 products per patient ) , while 36% used them for the cancer itself ( average: 1.1 products each ) .
Patients below 55 significant dominated the last-mentioned group .
Among the patients , 53% believed that the products could strengthen their immune system , while 18% believed that they could contribute in their fight against cancer .
However , as many as 62% answered " I don't know " to this question .
As to what was true about the products , 86% found it difficult to judge , and 76% wanted information primarily from health personnel .
One third had discussed the products with the doctor .
Only 8% felt this to be very useful ; hence communicating with cancer patients about herbs and dietary supplements can be a challenge , though at least it might help to discover side effects or interaction with the medicine given .
