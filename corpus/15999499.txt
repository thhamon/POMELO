[Effects of food and alcohol on the pharmacokinetics of vardenafil]. .
There is a close relationship between sexual activity and meals or alcohol consumption .
It is of great clinical significance for clinicians to understand the effects of food and alcohol on the pharmacokinetics of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor vardenafil so as to give correct instructions to patients .
Although a high-fat ( sentsup 55% fat calories ) meal modestly reduces C ( max ) by 18% and prolongs t ( max ) of vardenafil by approximately 1 hour , no significant effects of a typical moderate-fat meal ( 30% fat calories ) on vardenafil pharmacokinetics were observed in a study carried out in 25 healthy adult males .
So the adjustment of vardenafil dosage is not warranted based on a wide therapeutic index and the efficacy observed with vardenafil in Phase III studies , which need not be restricted with respect to food .
In another study , the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of vardenafil were not affected if it was taken together with 0.5 g  kg ethanol .
The above characteristics of vardenafil make the administration more convenient for patients .
