The influence of food on the absorption and metabolism of drugs .
Food-drug interactions can lead to a loss of therapeutic efficacy or toxic effects of drug therapy .
Generally , the effect of food on drugs results from a reduction in the drug's bioavailability ; however , an alteration in drug clearance can occur due to the effect of certain foods on drug metabolism .
The proportion of adverse drug reactions due to food-drug interactions is not known and unfortunately only when a serious adverse drug reaction follows a food- drug interaction does the matter usually receive any significant attention .
In order to improve therapeutic efficacy and to help prevent adverse drug reactions , it is necessary that clinicians be knowledgeable of the important food- food-drug incompatibilities and risk factors related to the increased likelihood of developing an adverse drug reaction due to food-drug interactions .
