Tyramine pressor sensitivity in healthy subjects during combined treatment with moclobemide and selegiline .
The objectives of this double-blind study were to assess the tolerability and i.v. .
tyramine pressor response during combined treatment with moclobemide and selegiline .
Two parallel groups of 12 healthy male and female subjects were treated with 200 mg moclobemide or 5 mg selegiline b.d. .
for 14 days .
On Day 7 , selegiline or moclobemide was added to the other treatment .
IV tyramine pressor tests were conducted at baseline and at steady state during mono- and combined treatment .
Treatment with moclobemide and selegiline alone was well tolerated , whereas combined treatment led to a slight increase in adverse events .
Tyramine pressor sensitivity during moclobemide , selegiline and moclobemide + selegiline treatment was enhanced , on average , by 2.4- , 1.3- and 8.4-times , respectively .
Although combined treatment with moclobemide and selegiline was well tolerated , the supra-additive potentiation of the tyramine pressor effects means that dietary restriction of tyramine intake will be necessary during such combination therapy .
