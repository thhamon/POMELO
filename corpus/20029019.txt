Possible interaction between pomegranate juice and warfarin .
Pomegranate juice is growing in popularity in the UK .
We report a potential interaction between pomegranate juice and warfarin .
Laboratory studies have shown that pomegranate juice inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in warfarin metabolism .
As with previous reports of interactions between food and warfarin , this case does not definitively prove the association between pomegranate juice consumption and increased warfarin bioactivity but highlights the importance of taking a complete drug , food and juice history when assessing patients with unstable anticoagulation .
