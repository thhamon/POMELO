Comprehensive review of rasagiline , a second-generation monoamine oxidase inhibitor , for the treatment of Parkinson's disease .
Inhibitors of monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) with selectivity and specificity for MAO type B ( MAO-B ) prolong the duration of action of both endogenously and exogenously derived dopamine .
Rasagiline [N-propargyl-l ( R ) -aminoindan] is a second-generation propargylamine pharmacophore that selectively and irreversibly inhibits brain MAO-B and is specifically designed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease ( PD ) .
The aim of this study was to review the pharmacology , tolerability , and clinical efficacy of rasagiline in the treatment of PD .
MEDLINE ( 1966-April 2007 ) , the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts ( 1970-April 2007 ) were searched for original research and review articles published in English .
The search terms were monoamine oxidase , neuroprotection , Parkinson disease , propargylamine , rasagiline , and selegiline .
The reference lists of articles were also consulted , as was information provided by the manufacturer of rasagiline .
Data from 63 clinical and laboratory studies were analyzed .
Based on the results from those studies , we concluded that rasagiline PO QD , at the therapeutic dosage range of 0.5 to 1 rag  d , is effective and well tolerated and completely , selectively , and specifically inhibited MAO-B .
Pharmacologically , rasagiline was found to be sentinf or =10-fold more potent than selegiline and was not metabolized to amphetamine derivatives .
Rasagiline was effective both as monotherapy in early PD and as adjunctive treatment in patients with advancing PD and motor fluctuations .
As monotherapy , rasagiline provided modest yet clinically meaningful benefit .
A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study found that , after 26 weeks of treatment , the adjusted effect size for total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score was -4.20 ( 95% CI , -5.66 to -2.73 ) for rasagiline 1 mg  d versus placebo ( P sentinf 0.001 ) .
Preliminary long-term data from an open-label study suggest a sustained therapeutic advantage when rasagiline is initiated early ( before the need for dopaminergic agents ) rather than later .
In patients with more advanced disease who received treatment with dopaminergic agents , rasagiline and entacapone were associated with reductions of " off " time significantly greater than placebo ( -1.18 and -1.2 vs 0.4 hour ; both , P sentinf or = 0.001 ) .
Rasagiline was well tolerated in younger ( aged sentinf ; 70 years ) and older ( aged sentsup or =70 years ) patients with early or advanced PD .
Pharmacologically , rasagiline has the potential to augment the vasopressor effects of diet- diet-derived tyramine ( ie , the " cheese reaction " ) .
However , clinical challenge studies of tyramine have found this unlikely to occur even with ingestion of supraphysiologic amounts of tyramine .
In experimental models , rasagiline has been found to have neuroprotective properties that may be independent of MAO-B inhibition .
Based on this review , rasagiline has been found to be well tolerated and effective in the treatment of early PD and as adjunctive treatment in motor fluctuations .
Whether rasagiline is associated with clinically significant neuroprotection ( ie , disease modification ) in PD is the subject of ongoing clinical trials .
