Effects of food intake on the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac potassium soft gelatin capsules capsules: a single-dose , randomized , two-way crossover study .
Diclofenac potassium liquid- liquid-filled soft gelatin capsule ( DPSGC ) is an investigational formulation that uses dispersing agents designed to facilitate rapid and consistent absorption of this NSAID .
The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of food intake on the pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile of oral DPSGC at doses of 25 and 50 mg .
In this open-label , randomized , single-dose ( 2 distinct doses ) , 2-way crossover bioavailability study , healthy adult volunteers were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of DPSGC 25 or 50 mg after an overnight fast ( fasted condition ) or high-fat breakfast ( fed condition ) ( period 1 ) .
After 7 days , the participants received the same dose under the opposite fed  fasted condition ( period 2 ) .
Serial blood samples were obtained before and through 6 hours after study drug administration .
Concentrations of diclofenac in plasma were determined using HPLC , and PK profiles were studied using ANCOVA .
Adverse events ( AEs ) were monitored and recorded on each in-clinic day .
Of 47 participants included in the study , 24 received the 25-mg dose of DPSGC and 23 received the 50-mg dose .
The majority of participants were male ( 80.9% ) , and the mean age was 28.6 years .
The mean ( SD ) AUC values for the fasted and fed states were 691 ( 195 ) and 680 ( 184 ) ng x h  mL , respectively , with the 25-mg dose , and 1521 ( 377 ) and 1416 ( 366 ) ng .
h  mL , respectively , with the 50-mg dose , suggesting that the extent of absorption was similar with both dietary conditions at each dose .
Food intake was associated with decreases in C ( max ) by nearly half in the 25-mg group ( fasted vs fed , 1156 [482] vs 686 [411] ng  mL , respectively ; P sentinf 0.05 ) and the 50-mg group ( 2365 [1034] vs 1154 [592 ng  mL ; P sentinf 0.05 ) and delayed T ( max ) in the 25-mg group ( 0.49 [0.16] vs 1.02 [0.55] hours ; P sentinf 0.05 ) and 50-mg group ( 0.51 [0.19] vs 1.28 [0.71] hours ; P sentinf 0.05 ) .
Two mild AEs ( nasal congestion and light-headedness ) were reported in 2 participants who received 25 mg under fed conditions and 50 mg under fasted conditions , respectively .
Food intake did not appear to affect the extent of absorption ( ie , total exposure ) of oral DPSGC at doses of 25 and 50 mg in these healthy adult volunteers .
Both single doses appeared to be well tolerated .
