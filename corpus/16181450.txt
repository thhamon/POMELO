Diet and psoriasis psoriasis: experimental data and clinical evidence .
Psoriasis is considered as a T-cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease which is characterized by hyperproliferation and poor differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes .
While susceptibility to psoriasis is inherited , the disease is influenced by environmental factors such as infections and stress .
Diet has been suggested to play a role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of psoriasis .
Fasting periods , low-energy diets and vegetarian diets improved psoriasis symptoms in some studies , and diets rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish oil also showed beneficial effects .
All these diets modify the polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism and influence the eicosanoid profile , so that inflammatory processes are suppressed .
Some patients with psoriasis show an elevated sensitivity to gluten .
In patients with IgA and  or IgG antigliadin antibodies the symptoms have been shown to improve on a gluten- gluten-free diet .
The active form of vitamin D , 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D ( 3 ) , exhibits antiproliferative and immunoregulatory effects via the vitamin D receptor , and thus is successfully used in the topical treatment of psoriasis .
In this review , dietary factors which play a role in psoriasis are assessed and their potential benefit is evaluated .
Furthermore , the risk of drug-nutrient interactions in psoriasis therapy is discussed .
