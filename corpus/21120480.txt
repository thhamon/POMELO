A two-part phase II study of cediranib in patients with advanced solid tumours tumours: the effect of food on single-dose pharmacokinetics and an evaluation of safety , efficacy and imaging pharmacodynamics .
Cediranib ( RECENTINâ„¢ ) is an oral , highly potent VEGF inhibitor .
This study evaluated the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of cediranib and compared the administration of continual cediranib via two dosing strategies using this as a platform to investigate pharmacodynamic imaging biomarkers .
Sixty patients were randomised to receive two single doses of cediranib in either fed  fasted or fasted  fed state ( Part A ) .
In continual dosage phase ( Part B ) , patients were randomised to a fixed-dose or dose-escalation arm .
Exploratory pharmacodynamic assessments were performed using DCE-MRI and CT enhancing fraction ( EnF ) .
In part A , plasma AUC and C ( max ) of cediranib were lower in the presence of food by a mean of 24 and 33% , respectively ( 94% CI: AUC , 12-34% and C ( max ) , 20-43% ) , indicating food reduces cediranib plasma exposure .
In part B , cediranib 30 mg  day appeared to be the most sustainable for chronic dosing .
Continuous cediranib therapy was associated with sustained antivascular effects up to 16 weeks , with significant reductions in DCE-MRI parameters and CT EnF .
It is recommended that cediranib be administered at least 1 h before or 2 h after food .
Evidence of antitumour activity was observed , with significant sustained effects upon imaging vascular parameters .
