Aspirin enhances the induction of type I allergic symptoms when combined with food and exercise in patients with food- food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis .
We examined the effect of aspirin as a substitute for exercise in inducing urticaria  anaphylaxis in three patients with food- food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis ( FDEIA ) .
Two of the patients had specific IgE antibodies to wheat and the other had antibodies to shrimp .
Administration of aspirin before ingestion of food allergens induced urticaria in one patient and urticaria and hypotension in another , while aspirin alone or food alone elicited no response .
The third patient developed urticaria only when he took all three items , i.e i.e. aspirin , food and additional exercise , whereas provocation with any one or or two of these did not induce any symptoms .
These findings suggest that aspirin upregulates type I allergic responses to food in patients with FDEIA , and further shows that aspirin synergizes with exercise to provoke symptoms of FDEIA .
This is the first report of a synergistic effect of aspirin in inducing urticaria  anaphylaxis , which was confirmed using challenge tests in patients with FDEIA .
