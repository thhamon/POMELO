Maitake mushroom ( Grifola frondosa ) : systematic review by the natural standard research collaboration .
The objective of this study was to evaluate the scientific evidence on maitake , including expert opinion , folkloric precedent , history , pharmacology , kinetics  dynamics , interactions , adverse effects , toxicology , and dosing .
This review serves as a clinical support tool .
Electronic searches were conducted in 10 databases , 20 additional journals ( not indexed in common databases ) , and bibliographies from 50 selected secondary references .
No restrictions were placed on the language or quality of the publications .
All literature collected pertained to efficacy in humans , dosing , precautions , adverse effects , use in pregnancy and lactation , interactions , alteration of laboratory assays , and mechanisms of action .
Standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for selection .
Grades were assigned using an evidence-based grading rationale .
There was a lack of systematic study on the safety and effectiveness of maitake in humans .
However , based on popular use and supportive scientific data , three indications are discussed in this review: cancer , diabetes , and immunostimulation .
Despite the lack of scientific evidence , maitake mushroom remains a popular agent in commercial products .
Future randomized controlled trials are warranted .
