Refining the MAOI diet diet: tyramine content of pizzas and soy products .
Continuous refinement of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) diet has resulted in much reduced and simplified recommendations that attempt to balance safety and practicality .
In the spirit of evidence-based practice , dietary restrictions should be based on carefully documented case reports and valid tyramine analyses .
Residual concerns have focused on combination foods such as pizza and a variety of soy products .
We determined the tyramine content of pizzas and a variety of soy products in order to refine dietary recommendations for use with MAOIs .
High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of tyramine content was performed on a variety of pizzas , soy sauces , and other soybean products .
A tyramine level of 6 mg or less was considered safe .
No significant tyramine levels were found in any of the pizzas , including those with double pepperoni and double cheese .
Marked variability was found in soy products , including clinically significant tyramine levels in tofu when stored for a week and high tyramine content in one of the soy sauces .
Pizzas from large chain commercial outlets are safe for consumption with MAOIs .
However , caution must be exercised if ordering pizzas from smaller outlets or gourmet pizzas known to contain aged cheeses .
All soybean products should be avoided , especially soy sauce and tofu .
Individualized counseling and continuous surveillance of compliance are still essential .
