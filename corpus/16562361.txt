Antiretroviral treatment of HIV infection infection: Swedish recommendations 2005. .
On 2 earlier occasions , in 2002 and 2003 , the Swedish Medical Products Agency ( MPA ) and the Swedish Reference Group for Antiviral Therapy ( RAV ) have jointly publicized recommendations for the treatment of HIV infection .
A working group from the same expert team that produced the 2002 report has now revised the text again .
Since the publication of the last treatment recommendations , 4 new medicines have become available: emtricitabine , atazanavir , fosamprenavir , and enfuvirtid .
The last-mentioned belongs to a new class of HIV medications called fusion inhibitors ( Box 1 ) .
It is likely that tipranavir will also be on the market soon .
Simultaneously , the drug zalcitabin has been deregistered .
The following updated recommendations parallel the earlier ones , but increased knowledge allows us to be more specific in our recommendations .
Thus , it is now suggested that the initial treatment for HIV infection consist of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) and 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) ; or 2 NRTIs and 1 protease inhibitor ( PI ) .
In the group of the NRTIs , stavudine is no longer recommended for this purpose .
In the NNRTI group , efavirenz should be preferred to nevirapine , except under special circumstances .
Finally , PIs ought to be boosted with ritonavir ( PI  r ) .
Also new are recommendations regarding treatment choices for patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) or tuberculosis ( TB ) .
As in the case of the previous publication , recommendations are evidence-graded in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine , 2001 ( see http:   www.cebm.net  levels levels_of_evidence.asp#levels ) , and have been supplemented with references to newly-added sections and data not referred to in earlier background documentation .
