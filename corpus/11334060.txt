Weight gain and cardiovascular risk after organ transplantation .
Organ transplantation has become a common and effective approach to the management of patients with organ failure .
The improvement in long-term survival has resulted in the emergence of cardiovascular disease as the primary cause of death in renal transplant patients and a significant complication in other organ recipients .
A number of factors explain this trend , including a high incidence of hypertension , posttransplant diabetes , hyperlipidemia , and obesity- obesity-risk factors that are mediated by direct effects of immunosuppressive medications .
Weight gain posttransplant affects approximately 50% of patients and represents a significant problem because of the potential synergism between obesity and immunosuppressive medication-induced effects on cardiovascular disease risk factor development .
This review discusses the incidence and implications of cardiovascular disease risk factors in organ transplant recipients , strategies for clinical management , and future research directions .
