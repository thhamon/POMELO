Differences in lercanidipine systemic exposure when administered according to labelling: in fasting state and 15 minutes before food intake .
The aim of this study was to compare the systemic exposure of lercanidipine ( Zanidip ) after oral administration in the fasted state and 15 min before food intake ( meals ) to investigate if the recommendations in the Summary of Product Characteristics ( SPC ) with respect to the intake of meals are adequate .
The results of three pilot bioequivalence studies performed to develop a lercanidipine generic product , where Zanidip was administered consistently as reference product in the fasted state or 15 min before a standard breakfast , were compared to estimate the drug–food interaction and the similarity of the methods of administration defined in the SPC .
The ingestion of a standard ( non-high-fat , non-high-calorie ) meal 15 min after drug intake increased the area under the concentration–time curve ( AUC ( 0-t ) ) of S-lercanidipine by 1.78-fold [90% confidence interval ( CI ) 1.48–2.15 , Psentinf0.0001] and the maximum concentration ( Cmax ) of Slercanidipine by 1.82-fold ( 90% CI 1.46–2.28 , Psentinf0.0001 ) .
These values are close to the twofold increase that has been described when Zanidip was taken immediately after a carbohydrate- carbohydrate-rich meal .
Higher levels would be expected with a high-fat , high-calorie meal .
As intake with a carbohydrate- carbohydrate-rich meal is not recommended in the SPC of Zanidip because a twofold difference was considered to be clinically relevant , the intake of lercanidipine only 15 min before food intake does not seem to be consistent with this recommendation .
The Marketing Authorisation Holder should clarify the dosing instructions in relation to meals and identify a sufficient time-lapse to ensure an exposure similar to that obtained in phase III clinical efficacy studies .
