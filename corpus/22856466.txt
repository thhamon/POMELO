Flaxseed does not enhance the estrogenic effect of low-dose estrogen therapy on markers of uterine health in ovariectomized rats .
Flaxseed ( FS ) is an oilseed rich in phytoestrogens and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids , compounds that may attenuate bone loss during aging .
We previously demonstrated using the ovariectomized ( OVX ) rat model of postmenopausal osteoporosis that 10% dietary FS combined with low-dose estrogen therapy ( LD ) preserves vertebral bone mass and strength more so than either treatment alone .
However , it was prudent to also consider the effect of this intervention on uterine tissue as LD , and possibly FS , may have estrogenic , and thus negative , effects on uterine tissue .
The present study investigated if FS enhances the estrogenic effect of LD on markers of uterine health in OVX rats .
Three-month-old rats were randomized to groups: ( 1 ) SHAM , ( 2 ) OVX , ( 3 ) OVX+FS , ( 4 ) OVX+LD , or ( 5 ) OVX+FS+LD .
Ground FS was added to the AIN-93M diet ( 100 g  kg of diet ) , and LD was delivered by subcutaneous implant ( 0.42 μg of 17β-estradiol  kg of body weight  day ) to mimic LD in postmenopausal women .
After 12 weeks , histological analyses of uterine tissue demonstrated flattened or cuboidal luminal epithelia organized in a single layer in the OVX group , while FS , LD , and FS+LD induced a single layer of elongated luminal epithelia , columnar in shape .
The SHAM group had the greatest epithelial mass .
Cell proliferation was similar among all OVX groups .
Therefore FS and FS+LD similarly induce estrogen- estrogen-like effects on the morphology of luminal epithelia that are weaker than in the SHAM group without inducing cell proliferation in OVX rats .
Thus , FS does not enhance the estrogenic effect of LD on markers of uterine health in OVX rats .
