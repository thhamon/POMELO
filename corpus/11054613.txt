Dofetilide Dofetilide: a new pure class III antiarrhythmic agent .
Although there are a variety of antiarrhythmic agents used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation of flutter , each drug has drawbacks , and room exists for new pharmacologic agents .
Dofetilide , a pure class III agent , has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for therapy of these arrhythmias and is reviewed .
Data for dofetilide , published in full or in abstract form , were reviewed , concentrating on the properties related to its efficacy for the therapy of supraventricular arrhythmias .
Results from animal and human studies indicate that dofetilide , a renally excreted drug , has pure class III properties related to blockade of the delayed rectifier potassium current .
It is effective for the therapy of atrial arrhythmias , particularly atrial fibrillation and flutter , and has no demonstrable negative inotropic effect .
Despite an incidence of torsades de pointes of approximately 2% in patients with impaired ventricular function , dofetilide exhibited no association with an increased mortality rate when studied in a large series of patients with a reduced ejection fraction .
Dofetilide' Dofetilide's electrophysiologic and clinical profiles suggest that it will be safe and clinically useful for the termination and prevention of atrial fibrillation or flutter , even in patients with impaired ventricular function .
