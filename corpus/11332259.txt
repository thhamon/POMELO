[ 'Licorice hypertension hypertension' also caused by licorice tea] tea]. .
A 41-year-old woman , who presented with ( apparent ) essential hypertension , was treated with atenolol and candesartan .
This treatment , however , was unsuccessful .
After the addition of hydrochlorothiazide ( HCT ) to the combination , she developed hypokalaemia with muscle cramps and weakness .
This hypokalaemia persisted for more than 4 weeks after discontinuation of HCT and starting potassium suppletion .
As a result of polyuria ( sentsup 4000 ml  day ) found in a 24-hour urine collection , it was discovered that the patient drank at least 3 litres of liquorice tea a day .
She had denied eating liquorice sweets , a well-known cause of hypertension in the Netherlands , but no one had thought of asking her if she drank liquorice tea .
Blood pressure and serum potassium normalized about 2 months after she stopped drinking liquorice tea , and medication was withdrawn .
In a patient presenting with hypertension and hypokalaemia , who denies eating liquorice sweets , one should consider the consumption of other products containing liquorice such as liquorice tea .
In the Netherlands liquorice tea is increasingly popular and has recently become available on a large scale .
Therefore more cases such as the one described may be expected in coming years .
