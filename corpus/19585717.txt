Cilostazol Cilostazol: new drug .
Intermittent claudication claudication: too little efficacy , too many risks .
( 1 ) Intermittent claudication is usually a sign of generalised vascular atheroma , with prognosis mainly depending on the degree of coronary and cerebral involvement .
Treatment is based on smoking cessation and regular exercise .
Vasodilators have a purely symptomatic effect , modest at best , in increasing walking distance ; ( 2 ) Cilostazol , a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor , is licensed in France ( after 20 years on the market in Japan ) as a treatment intended to increase walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication ; ( 3 ) A double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 1439 patients showed no reduction in mortality after 3 years of treatment ; ( 4 ) Cilostazol has been compared with pentoxifylline , another vasodilator with uncertain efficacy , in 3 clinical trials .
No tangible difference in efficacy was observed ; ( 5 ) A meta-analysis of 7 double-blind placebo-controlled trials in a total of 1579 patients showed that cilostazol increased the pain- pain-free walking distance by about 30 metres and the maximum walking distance by about 50 metres ; ( 6 ) There is some evidence that cilostazol causes a dose-dependent increase in mortality , although the data are not statistically significant .
However , excess mortality has been documented with other phosphodiesterase III inhibitors , especially in patients with heart failure ; ( 7 ) Cilostazol can provoke dose-dependent cardiac arrhythmias , and sometimes haemorrhage ( due to its antiplatelet effect ) ; ( 8 ) Cilostazol is extensively metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP 3A4 and CYP 2C6 , creating a high risk of pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs and with food ; ( 9 ) In practice , patients with intermittent claudication should not be given cilostazol ; they should instead be prescribed an antiplatelet drug and encouraged to stop smoking and to exercise regularly .
