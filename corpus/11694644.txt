Biopharmacologic and herbal therapies for cancer cancer: research update from NCCAM .
During the past decade , use of complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) by the American public increased from 34% in 1990 to 42% in 1995 with related out-of-pocket expenditures estimated at sentdol27 billion .
Among cancer patients , use of CAM ranges between 30 and 75% worldwide and includes dietary approaches , herbals and other biologically based treatments such as melatonin , mushrooms , shark cartilage and high dose vitamins and minerals .
Concerns about herb-nutrient-drug interactions and product quality and standardization emphasize the need for rigorous research .
In 1998 , Congress mandated the creation of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM ) to conduct and support such research of CAM therapies .
The NCCAM portfolio for oncology is rapidly growing .
As of July 2001 , 26 projects are underway , two specialized centers are funded for cancer research and four botanical centers are cofunded with the Office of Dietary Supplements .
Investigations are targeting herbals and complex herbal formulas ; single dietary supplements and complex dietary regimens ; biological agents ; and mind-body , body-based and frontier approaches .
Of these , biopharmacologic and herbal therapies are a major focus of research .
The NCCAM portfolio illustrates how research of CAM , particularly studies of biopharmacologic and herbal approaches for cancer , is developing systematically and rigorously .
