[Clinically significant " new drug interactions] interactions]. .
The concomitant intake of drugs with the potential to cause drug interactions is frequent .
In contrast , adverse effects due to drug interactions account for only a small fraction of all adverse effects .
A reproducible evaluation of the clinical relevance of drug interactions is lacking .
We now can accurately define the potential of a drug to cause interactions , primarily by comparative investigations within a drug class .
Whether or not the selection of the drug based on this information is useful for the patient is unknown .
Therefore , usually it is to be recommended to abandon therapeutically reasonable drug combinations with a risk for interactions only if equivalent therapeutic options are available .
Several actual examples on interactions with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors , HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors , mibefradil , sildenafil , protease inhibitors and with grapefruit juice are discussed .
