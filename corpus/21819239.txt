Old versus new oral anticoagulants anticoagulants: focus on pharmacology .
Since the discovery of heparin nearly a century ago , there have been large gaps in the development of anticoagulants .
The discovery of warfarin was the first step toward using oral anticoagulants , but warfarin use has been associated with its own challenges from the perspectives of the prescribing physician and the patient .
Warfarin , along with other coumarins , has a narrow therapeutic index , requires frequent monitoring , exhibits interindividual response variations , and is associated with several adverse effects .
Frequent drug and food interactions contribute to potential safety and efficacy compromise .
The indications for use of oral anticoagulants have increased , as these drugs are used not only for thrombosis management but also for cardiovascular indications , producing more challenges for oral anticoagulant use .
Factor Xa and thrombin targeting has provided a rational approach to develop new oral anticoagulants with improvements over warfarin .
In this review , the pharmacology of warfarin and the pharmacology of the newly developed oral anti-Xa and antithrombin agents are discussed .
