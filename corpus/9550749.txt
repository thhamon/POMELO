[Excessive terfenadine level due to drinking grapefruit juice] juice]. .
Doctors who prescribe drugs should be aware not only of potential drug-drug interactions , but also of potential food- food-drug interactions .
In particular , the ingestion of grapefruit juice leads to enhanced systemic bioavailability of terfenadine and of several important and frequently prescribed other drugs .
Components of grapefruit juice interfere with the function of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 , which degrades terfenadine .
The resulting enhanced blood levels of terfenadine may lead to heart rate disturbances .
Selling the drugs involved over the counter is consequently risky .
