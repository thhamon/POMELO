The absorption of ( 99m ) Tc-alendronate given by rectal route in rabbits .
Alendronate sodium ( ALD ) is a bisphosphonate medication used in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis .
Absorption of ALD as oral formulation is very poor ( 0.5%-1% ) .
Its bioavailability can decrease with food effect .
It has some gastrointestinal adverse effects such as gastritis , gastric ulcer , and esophagitis .
The aim of this study was to develop a rectal formulation of ALD as an alternative to oral route and to investigate the absorption of it by using gamma scintigraphy .
For this reason , ALD was labeled with Technetium-99 Technetium-99m ( ( 99m ) Tc ) by direct method .
The radiochemical characterization of the ( 99m ) Tc-ALD was carried out by paper chromatography , thin layer chromatography , and electrophoresis methods .
The labeling efficiency of ( 99m ) Tc-ALD was found 99% without significant changes until 6 h postlabeling at room temperature .
The rectal suppositories containing ( 99m ) Tc-ALD were prepared by fusion method using polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 1500. .
The ( 99m ) Tc-labeled ALD suppositories were administrated to rabbits by rectal route .
Serial scintigrams over all bodies of the rabbits were obtained at different time intervals using a gamma camera .
We found that the rectal absorption of ( 99m ) Tc-ALD from suppository formulation was possible .
According to our results , this formulation of ALD can be suggested for the therapy of osteoporosis as an alternative route .
