Histamine poisoning after ingestion of spoiled raw tuna in a patient taking isoniazid .
An 83-year-old woman taking isoniazid ( INH ) suddenly developed a headache , palpitations , and skin eruptions with itching while eating raw tuna .
The symptoms were compatible with those of histamine intoxication .
When given fresh raw tuna to eat , no such reactions were evoked in this patient .
The episode was speculated to be due to two conditions ; eating spoiled raw tuna and at the same time being on a course of INH , a potent histaminase inhibitor .
We should therefore be aware of the possible adverse effects due to the interactions between drugs and foods .
