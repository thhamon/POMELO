[Adherence to antiretroviral therapy during HIV infection , a multidisciplinary approach]. .
Since HIV infection has become a chronic disease , antiretroviral therapy is now used on a long-term basis .
Response to treatment is conditioned by numerous inter-dependent factors , including non-compliance , which can result in failure of the therapeutic regimen .
Although compliance is crucial for long-term efficacy of the treatment , it is a dynamic factor , and therefore difficult to evaluate .
This literature review proposes a multidisciplinary approach to treatment adherence during HIV infection , and deals with the following questions: how should adherence and non-adherence be defined ?
How are they correlated to the treatment response ?
How is adherence measured in trials and cohorts , as well as in clinical practice ?
By what factors is it influenced ?
What tools can be implemented to improve adherence ?
The interaction between adherence and response to antiretroviral therapy requires communication between clinicians , healthcare providers , patients , virologists , pharmacologists , and the companies responsible for developing drugs .
The pharmaceutical industry must sustain its efforts to ensure a balance between demands for efficacy and adherence when developing new drugs .
And the methods implemented by numerous healthcare teams plead in favour of a dynamic approach to adherence , with the active participation of all .
