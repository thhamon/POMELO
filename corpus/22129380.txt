Pomegranate as a functional food and nutraceutical source .
Pomegranate , a fruit native to the Middle East , has gained widespread popularity as a functional food and nutraceutical source .
The health effects of the whole fruit , as well as its juices and extracts , have been studied in relation to a variety of chronic diseases .
Promising results against cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and prostate cancer have been reported from human clinical trials .
The in vitro antioxidant activity of pomegranate has been attributed to its high polyphenolic content , specifically punicalagins , punicalins , gallagic acid , and ellagic acid .
These compounds are metabolized during digestion to ellagic acid and urolithins , suggesting that the bioactive compounds that provide in vivo antioxidant activity may not be the same as those present in the whole food .
Anthocyanins and the unique fatty acid profile of the seed oil may also play a role in pomegranate' pomegranate's health effects .
A more complete characterization of pomegranate components and their physiological fate may provide mechanistic insight into the potential health benefits observed in clinical trials .
