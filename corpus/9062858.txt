The propensity of different brands of tea and coffee to cause staining associated with chlorhexidine .
Dental staining is a well known and probably the most problematic side effect of using chlorhexidine oral products .
Whatever mechanisms are involved , there is no doubt that cationic antiseptics , such as chlorhexidine , can precipitate or bind to surfaces anionic chromogens contained in foods and beverages .
The aim of this study in vitro was to determine whether , under controlled conditions , different brands of tea or coffee varied in their propensity to cause staining associated with chlorhexidine .
Optically clear acrylic specimens were cycled through saliva , chlorhexidine and different tea and coffee solutions .
Staining was measured using a spectrophotometer .
After 15 cycles , it was apparent that staining varied at the extreme , both within and between the tea and coffee groups .
All coffee brands produced less staining than the tea brands .
The least staining coffee and least staining tea brands were approximately 3x less chromogenic than the most staining equivalent beverage .
Previous randomised controlled clinical trials have indicated that tea and coffee contribute to dental and tongue staining associated with chlorhexidine mouthrinses .
Additionally , abstinence from tea and coffee significantly reduces staining .
The results of this study in vitro suggest that when abstinence is difficult , tea and coffee brands of low chromogenicity may be recommended .
Clearly these data in vitro require validation in vivo .
