Drug-nutrient interactions interactions: a case and clinical guide .
Advances in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics require new competencies related to pharmaceutical prescribing .
First , both physicians and pharmacists need to recognize the potential negative impact of nutrients and dietary supplements on the absorption , metabolism , and utilization of prescription drugs .
Second , physicians , even more than pharmacists , need to recognize the potential negative effects of pharmaceuticals on the absorption , metabolism , and utilization of nutrients .
This article discusses common drug-nutrient interactions and presents a case that illustrates how unrecognized nutrient disruption may negatively affect a patient's health and potentially result in unnecessary prescribing of medications .
In presenting the case , we also provide a conceptual framework for assessing and treating this patient and a summary of current knowledge regarding drug-nutrient interactions .
