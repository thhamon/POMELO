Species difference in the effect of grapefruit juice on intestinal absorption of talinolol between human and rat .
Bioavailability of talinolol , a beta ( 1 ) -adrenergic receptor antagonist , was enhanced by coadministration with grapefruit juice ( GFJ ) in rats , whereas GFJ ingestion markedly reduced the absorption of talinolol in humans .
Because our recent study indicated that the inhibitory effect of GFJ on organic anion- anion-transporting polypeptide ( Oatp ) - and P-gp-mediated talinolol absorption depends on the concentration of naringin in ingested GFJ , the apparent inconsistent findings may be explained by the species difference in the affinity of naringin for OATP  Oatp and P-gp multidrug resistance 1 ( MDR1  Mdr1 ) between humans and rats .
Although human MDR1-mediated talinolol transport was not inhibited by 2000 microM naringin , naringin inhibited human OATP1A2- , rat Oatp1a5- , and rat Mdr1a-mediated talinolol transport with IC ( 50 ) values of 343 , 12.7 , and 604 microM , respectively , in LLC-PK1 cell and Xenopus laevis oocyte systems .
Because the naringin concentration in commercially prepared GFJ was found to be approximately 1200 microM , these results suggested that GFJ would reduce the intestinal absorption of talinolol through inhibition of OATP1A2-mediated talinolol uptake in humans , whereas an increase of talinolol absorption is mainly through inhibition of Mdr1a-mediated efflux in rats .
The rat intestinal permeability of talinolol measured by the in situ closed loop method was indeed significantly increased in the presence of GFJ , whereas a significant decrease was observed with 6-fold diluted GFJ , in which the naringin concentration was approximately 200 microM .
The present study indicated that the species difference in the effect of GFJ on intestinal absorption of talinolol between humans and rats may be due to differences in the affinity of naringin for OATP  Oatp and MDR1  Mdr1 transporters between the two species .
