Single-dose pharmacokinetics and safety of iptakalim hydrochloride in Chinese healthy volunteers .
To investigate the safety , pharmacokinetics and food effect of iptakalim in healthy adult Han Chinese volunteers .
Study 1 was a randomized open-label , Latin square designed , single-dose , three-period , self-control crossover study .
Six men and six women received 5 , 10 and 20 mg of iptakalim orally .
Study 2 was a randomized , open-label , single-dose , two-period , self-control crossover study .
Ten men were included and each subject received 5 mg iptakalim orally , fasting and nonfasting .
No adverse effects were reported and no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs were found .
Cmax , AUC ( 0-t ) and AUC ( 0-∞ ) were proportional over the dose levels of 5 , 10 and 20 mg .
Tmax , tbigasenttydemi and CL  F were similarly independent of dose level .
In the 5 mg and 20 mg group , the Cmax , AUC ( 0-t ) and AUC ( 0-∞ ) in women were significantly higher than in men , although they showed no difference after correction by mg  kg doses in the 5 mg group .
At the 5-mg dose level , no significant difference in pharmacokinetics was found in nonfasting and fasting subjects .
Single-dose pharmacokinetics of iptakalim showed dose proportionality over the dose levels of 5-20 mg .
The pharmacokinetics showed gender differences in the 5 and 20 mg groups .
Food had almost no impact on the pharmacokinetics at the 5 mg level .
