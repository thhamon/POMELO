Emergency department attendances associated with drug-related problems in paediatrics .
To determine the frequency and characteristics of paediatric emergency department attendances associated with drug-related problems ( DRP ) at three Victorian hospitals .
All paediatric medical patients attending the emergency department of the Royal Children's Hospital , Geelong Hospital or Box Hill Hospital were considered for inclusion .
The investigator and attending medical practitioners screened eligible patients .
A multidisciplinary panel reviewed collated data .
Causality , preventability and clinical significance classifications were established by the panel .
Combining data from the three hospitals , over 18 weeks of data collection , a total of 8601 patients met the eligibility criteria .
Of these , 280 ( 3.3% , 95% CI 2.9-3.7% ) were determined to have emergency department attendances associated with DRP .
Of the 187 cases assessed for preventability , 51.3% were judged to be preventable .
Emergency department attendances are associated with DRP in paediatrics .
Given that the need to prevent DRP in adults is recognized , it is now time to act to reduce the consequences of DRP in paediatrics .
