Safety of rasagiline for the treatment of Parkinson's disease .
Levodopa remains the gold standard treatment for Parkinson's disease ( PD ) , but chronic treatment induces motor fluctuations and dyskinesias .
Other dopaminergic agents , such as dopamine agonists , catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors and monoamine oxidase B enzyme inhibitors ( MAO-B I ) have also been developed to treat patients with PD .
Rasagiline is a second generation MAO-B I inducing moderate symptomatic and possibly disease-modifying benefits with apparently good tolerability and safety profile in PD patients .
The safety of rasagiline in early or advanced PD is discussed .
Details about clinical trial data , post hoc analysis in the elderly or regarding cognitive or behavioral effects , food- food-drug interactions and effects on levodopa- levodopa-induced dyskinesias are given .
Rasagiline is effective and well tolerated in PD as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa .
There was no evidence of a difference in tolerability between younger or older PD patients included in published trials .
Food interactions studies with tyramine did not provide evidence of clinical concerns .
Drug interaction should be monitored .
The risk of serotonin toxicity with serotoninergic antidepressants remains insufficiently characterized , while current available data in small groups of subjects suggest a low risk .
