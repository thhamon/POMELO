Recommendations for the use of medications with continuous enteral nutrition .
Recommendations for the use of medications with continuous enteral nutrition are provided .
A literature review was conducted to identify primary literature reporting medication interactions with continuous enteral nutrition .
For medications without supporting literature , manufacturers were contacted for information .
Package inserts for specific medications were also investigated for any information to help guide recommendations .
If no specific recommendations were made by the pharmaceutical manufacturer or the package insert concerning administration of products with continuous enteral nutrition , a tertiary database was consulted .
Recommendations were generated by a consensus of clinicians for those medications that lacked specific recommendations in the primary literature or from the pharmaceutical manufacturer .
Documentation of medication interactions with continuous enteral nutrition and food was then collated along with specific recommendations on how to administer the medication with regard to continuous enteral nutrition .
Recommendations were classified as strong ( grade 1 ) or weak ( grade 2 ) .
The quality of evidence was classified as high ( grade A ) , moderate ( grade B ) , or low ( grade C ) .
Forty-six medications commonly given to hospitalized patients were evaluated .
Twenty-four medications had recommendations based on available data , and the remaining 22 medications had recommendations based on a consensus of clinicians .
There was a lack of published data regarding drug-nutrient interactions for a majority of the drugs commonly administered to patients receiving continuous enteral nutrition .
Clinicians should recognize potential drug-nutrient interactions and use available evidence to optimize patients' drug therapy .
