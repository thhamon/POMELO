NSAIDs NSAIDs: take with food or after fasting ?
Published and regulatory advice is to take NSAIDs with fluids and  or food irrespective whether NSAIDs are taken over the counter or long-term .
The basis for this recommendation is not clear and we sought to establish the reasons for it through a search of published literature and personal files .
Results from experimental animals show that fasting increases the gastric side effects of NSAIDs while food increases small bowel damage , but this has not been tested in humans .
The possible effects of food in modifying the gastric damage caused by NSAIDs are complex , as food quantity and composition modify the responses substantially .
Food usually delays peak levels of NSAIDs ( and hence onset of action ) without affecting total bioavailability .
This may not be important when a steady state is achieved , but rapid onset of action is highly relevant for over-the-counter use of NSAIDs .
The safety of over-the-counter use of ibuprofen and naproxen appears to be excellent and comparable with paracetamol .
The rapid onset of action of NSAIDs is most important during over-the-counter use , in which case it may be more appropriate to take the drugs on a fasting stomach .
