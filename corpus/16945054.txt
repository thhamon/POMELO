Interaction between warfarin and cranberry juice .
Warfarin is extensively used for anticoagulation to a target international normalized ratio of 2.0-3.0 for most indications or 2.5-3.5 for high-risk indications ; however , many drugs and dietary supplements induce fluctuations in the international normalized ratio .
Such fluctuations may lead to therapeutic failure or bleeding complications .
Cranberry juice is increasingly used for the prevention and adjunctive treatment of urinary tract infections .
The United Kingdom's Committee on Safety of Medicines has alerted clinicians to a potential interaction between warfarin and cranberry juice and has advised that patients avoid their concurrent use .
Review and analysis of the literature revealed that ingestion of large volumes of cranberry juice destabilize warfarin therapy .
Small amounts of juice are not expected to cause such an interaction .
Clinicians should be aware of this potential interaction and monitor and counsel patients accordingly .
