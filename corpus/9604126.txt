The influence of food on the disposition of the antiepileptic rufinamide in healthy volunteers .
The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the antiepileptic rufinamide was investigated in healthy volunteers .
Twelve subjects were treated with single pre-oral doses of 600 mg of rufinamide after overnight fasting or a fat and protein rich breakfast .
Mean ( +  - S.D. .
) areas under the plasma concentration-time curves ( AUCs ) of the unchanged compound were 57.2 ( 16 ) micrograms mL-1 h when given to the fasted volunteers and 81.7 ( 22.2 ) micrograms mL-1 h ( p = 0.0001 ) when given after the breakfast .
The average AUC was increased by 44% when rufinamide was given with food and the maximum concentration ( Cmax ) by about 100%. .
The time at which Cmax was reached ( tmax ) was shorter ( 8 h in fasted conditions and 6 h in fed after breakfast ) ; the terminal half-life was not influenced by concomitant intake of food .
