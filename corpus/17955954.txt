[Oral anticoagulants anticoagulants: a literature review of herb-drug interactions or food- food-drug interactions] interactions]. .
To identify herbal medicines and food products which can interact with anticoagulant therapy .
Literature review using key words: " anticoagulants " , " herb-drug interaction " , " food-drug interaction " , " drug chinese herbal " , " medicine herbal " , " plant preparation " , " dietary supplements " .
Data sources: Medline ( january 1966 to june 2006 ) and Pascal ( 1987 to 2006 ) .
Case reports , systematic reviews , in vitro studies , clinical studies published in french or in english ( or with an english extract ) have been undertaken .
Eighty articles were selected ( two both including a case report and a study ) : 14 systemic review , 43 case reports , 25 studies ( 17 studies in humans: nine randomized and controlled , three controlled ) , six controlled studies in animals and two in vitro studies .
A wide range of herbal medicines and food products can interact with anticoagulants .
Clinical relevance of these effects is difficult to characterise ( nature of existing reports , contradiction between studies , difficult extrapolation to human ) .
It is difficult to predict the incidence or severity of such interactions .
However , awareness of these potential interactions is necessary to achieve optimal anticoagulation therapy: pharmacist can play a crucial role identifying such interactions in case of disturbed INR ; clinicians should be informed to monitor closely the therapy , particularly when such products are started or discontinued .
