Special low-protein foods ameliorate postprandial off in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease .
Protein intake interferes with levodopa therapy .
Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease ( PD ) should restrict daily protein intake and shift protein intake to the evening .
For further reduction of protein intake in the first part of the day , special low-protein products ( LPP ) should be used instead of normal food products at breakfast and lunch .
We studied the efficacy of LPP on postprandial off periods , in PD patients on levodopa therapy .
The methods included a randomized , cross-over , single-blind , pilot clinical trial comparing a 2-month balanced diet with a 2-month LPP diet in 18 PD patients with motor fluctuations .
The off phases were significantly shorter after LPP diet than after balanced diet ( postprandial off , 49 +  - 73 min vs. .
79 +  - 72 min and total off , 164 +  - 148 min vs. .
271 +  - 174 min , both P sentinf 0.0001 ) .
Moreover , a reduction in total off time during LPP diet ( 3.3 +  - 2.7 hr vs. .
4.7 +  - 3.3 hr , P sentinf 0.0001 ) , occurred also in the 9 patients who did not experience subjective benefit .
No significant changes in hematological and biochemical variables or body composition were recorded ; a slight reduction in body weight ( mean , -1.8% ) was observed .
Consumption of LPP in the first part of the day ameliorates off periods in PD patients , but additional studies including pharmacokinetics are needed .
