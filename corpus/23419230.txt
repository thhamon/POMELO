MAOIs: issues in treatment adherence and rates of treatment failure .
Treatment guidelines recommend initiating newer antidepressants as first-line therapy for patients with depression , but response and remission rates remain low and multiple treatment trials are often needed .
Adherence to medication affects response and remission rates , and nonadherence is common among patients with depression .
While MAOIs have proven efficacy for depression , particularly for patients with treatment-resistant or atypical depression , this class of drugs is underprescribed due , in part , to concerns over dietary and drug restrictions that are required to avoid potential serious side effects .
However , a newer MAOI formulation has an improved safety and tolerability profile and avoids or lessens the need for dietary restrictions , giving clinicians another option for treating patients who may be nonadherent or nonresponsive to their current antidepressant .
