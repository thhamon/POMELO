Lignan-rich sesame seed negates the tumor- tumor-inhibitory effect of tamoxifen but maintains bone health in a postmenopausal athymic mouse model with estrogen- estrogen-responsive breast tumors .
Flaxseed , the richest source of mammalian lignan precursors , enhances the tumor growth-inhibitory effect of tamoxifen while exerting no adverse effects on other estrogen- estrogen-responsive tissues such as bone .
Ingestion of sesame seed produces mammalian lignans comparable with flaxseed , but its anticancer potential is unknown .
This study determined the interactive effects of sesame seed and tamoxifen on established MCF-7 tumor growth and bone health in ovariectomized athymic mice simulating a postmenopausal condition .
Mice with established MCF-7 tumors were treated for 8 weeks with ( 1 ) basal diet ( negative control ) , ( 2 ) 10% sesame seed , ( 3 ) basal diet + tamoxifen implant , ( 4 ) 10% sesame seed + tamoxifen implant , or ( 5 ) basal diet + estrogen implant ( positive control ) .
Weekly palpable tumor size , final tumor weight , cell proliferation , and apoptosis were measured .
Bone mineral content , bone mineral density , and biomechanical strength testing were performed on the femur and lumbar vertebrae .
Sesame seed induced regression of established tumor size similar to the negative control but tended to negate the tumor- tumor-inhibitory effect of tamoxifen , in part by reducing apoptosis .
Sesame seed combined with tamoxifen induced higher bone mineral content , bone mineral density , and biomechanical strength in the femur and lumbar vertebrae than either treatment alone .
A significant positive relationship was found between final tumor weight and bone strength parameters .
Sesame seed is not protective and negatively interferes with tamoxifen in inducing regression of established MCF-7 tumor size but beneficially interacts with tamoxifen on bone in ovariectomized athymic mice .
