Lack of effect of a high-fat meal on the bioavailability of 17 norgestimate in healthy postmenopausal women .
The effect of a high-fat meal on the absorption and pharmacokinetics of 17 beta-estradiol ( E2 ) , estrone ( E1 ) , estrone sulfate ( E1S ) , and 17-deacetylnorgestimate ( 17d-NGM ) were determined in this two-way complete crossover study of a single dose of E2  NGM ( 2 mg  180 micrograms ) in 24 postmenopausal women .
Equal numbers of subjects were randomly assigned to two treatment sequences indicated by the order of fed and fasting treatments .
Serial blood samples were collected before and after dosing and assayed using validated methods .
Food had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of E2 , the pharmacologically active estrogen species .
Food increased the rates of formation of E1 and E1S and slowed the formation of 17d-NGM .
However , because E1 and E1S are pharmacologically less active metabolites of E2 , and since the pharmacokinetic alterations in 17d-NGM were observed over a short time period , these results are probably of no clinical relevance .
The extent of formation of all analytes , as measured by AUC , was not affected by food .
In conclusion , administration of a tablet containing 17 beta-estradiol term ( 2 mg  180 micrograms ) was safe and well tolerated by healthy postmenopausal women and may be given without regard to the timing of meals in relation to dosing .
