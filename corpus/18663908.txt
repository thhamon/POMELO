Grapefruit contains active bioflavonoids that may change bioavailability of many medications and raise its concentrations above toxic levels .
The mechanism of interaction is complex and connected with the influence of GJ active ingredients on prehepatic metabolism and enteric absorption pathways using p-glicoprotein ( PGP ) and organic anion transporting polipeptide ( OATP ) .
The main direction of GJ action is inhibition of cytochrome P450 1A2 and 3A4 isoforms .
A wide range of medicines used in daily psychiatric practice undergoes phase I oxidation with CYP 3A4 and 1A2 i.e. i.e.: anxiolytics , antidepressants , mood stabilizers , antipsychotics and procognitive compounds .
