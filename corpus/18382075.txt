Food and drug interaction interaction: consequences for the nutrition  health status .
Food-drug interactions are defined as alterations of pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of a drug or nutritional element or a compromise in nutritional status as a result of the addition of a drug .
Elderly patients are particularly at risk because more than 30% of all the prescription drugs are taken by this population .
Failure to identify and properly manage drug-nutrient interactions can lead to serious consequences .
For instance , drug-nutrient interactions can result in reduced absorption of certain oral antibiotics and may lead to suboptimal antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection .
This predisposes the patient to treatment failure .
Induction or inhibition of enzymes in the gut by nutrients may lead to a significant change in oral bioavailability of drugs or vice versa .
For example , grapefruit juice is a selective intestinal CYP3A4 inhibitor .
The overall exposure of some drugs can be increased by more than fivefold when taken with grapefruit juice and increase the risk of adverse effects .
The use of certain drugs may affect GI tract function and may lead to a loss of bodily electrolytes and fluid .
Limiting drug prescriptions to essential medications for as short a period as possible and periodic re-evaluations of the treatment chosen are essential to minimize adverse drug-nutrient interactions .
