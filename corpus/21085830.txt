Antituberculosis drugs: drug interactions , adverse effects , and use in special situations .
Part 1: first-line drugs .
The main objectives of tuberculosis therapy are to cure the patients and to minimize the possibility of transmission of the bacillus to healthy subjects .
Adverse effects of antituberculosis drugs or drug interactions ( among antituberculosis drugs or between antituberculosis drugs and other drugs ) can make it necessary to modify or discontinue treatment .
We briefly review the new guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of tuberculosis , introduced by the Brazilian National Ministry of Health in 2009 , and describe the general mechanism of action , absorption , metabolization , and excretion of the first-line drugs used in the basic regimen .
We describe adverse drug reactions and interactions ( with other drugs , food , and antacids ) , as well as the most appropriate approach to special situations , such as pregnancy , breastfeeding , liver failure , and kidney failure .
We also describe the mechanisms by which the interactions among the antituberculosis drugs used in the basic regimen can cause drug-induced hepatitis , and we discuss the alternatives in this situation .
