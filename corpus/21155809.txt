The quality of commercially available nutraceutical supplements and food sources .
Nutraceuticals are components of dietary origin , with claimed beneficial therapeutic activities .
The quality of nutraceuticals is paramount for efficacy and safety , and it includes quality of raw materials , different available chemical forms , complex products , lack of substitution of inappropriate materials , and the absence of contaminants .
The aim of this review is to investigate the extent of substandard formulated and raw material nutraceuticals , and to highlight any consequent health concern .
Reports of the quality of raw materials have revealed wide variations , often as a result of lack of clear regulatory definitions with respect to size of polymeric entities and also presence of glycosidic and salt forms .
Published evaluations of over 70 formulations of 25 different nutraceuticals revealed variable quality ; no nutraceutical showed consistent high quality , but a number revealed consistent low quality , thereby making the case for closer regulation of manufacturers .
Whole food sources have also been shown to be widely variable in constituent levels .
The effect of different formulations requires consideration , as the different types have been shown to have marked effects on bioavailability .
The poor quality of commercially available nutraceuticals has been highlighted .
In addition , incidences of side effects and drug interactions are increasing , as consumption of nutraceuticals rises .
Pharmacists and health practitioners need to be aware of the scientific literature to advise accordingly .
