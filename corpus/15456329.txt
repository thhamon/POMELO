Nabumetone Nabumetone: therapeutic use and safety profile in the management of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis .
Nabumetone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory prodrug , which exerts its pharmacological effects via the metabolite 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid ( 6-MNA ) .
Nabumetone itself is non-acidic and , following absorption , it undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to form the main circulating active metabolite ( 6-MNA ) which is a much more potent inhibitor of preferentially cyclo-oxygenase ( COX ) -2. .
The three major metabolic pathways of nabumetone are O-demethylation , reduction of the ketone to an alcohol , and an oxidative cleavage of the side-chain occurs to yield acetic acid derivatives .
Essentially no unchanged nabumetone and sentinf 1% of the major 6-MNA metabolite are excreted unchanged in the urine from which 80% of the dose can be recovered and another 10% in faeces .
Nabumetone is clinically used mainly for the management of patients with osteoarthritis ( OA ) or rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) to reduce pain and inflammation .
The clinical efficacy of nabumetone has also been evaluated in patients with ankylosing spondylitis , soft tissue injuries and juvenile RA .
The optimum oral dosage of nabumetone for OA patients is 1 g once daily , which is well tolerated .
The therapeutic response is superior to placebo and similar to nonselective COX inhibitors .
In RA patients , nabumetone 1 g at bedtime is optimal , but an additional 0.5-1 g can be administered in the morning for patients with persistent symptoms .
In RA , nabumetone has shown a comparable clinical efficacy to aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) , diclofenac , piroxicam , ibuprofen and naproxen .
Clinical trials and a decade of worldwide safety data and long-term postmarketing surveillance studies show that nabumetone is generally well tolerated .
The most frequent adverse effects are those commonly seen with COX inhibitors , which include diarrhoea , dyspepsia , headache , abdominal pain and nausea .
In common with other COX inhibitors , nabumetone may increase the risk of GI perforations , ulcerations and bleedings ( PUBs ) .
However , several studies show a low incidence of PUBs , and on a par with the numbers reported from studies with COX-2 selective inhibitors and considerably lower than for nonselective COX inhibitors .
This has been attributed mainly to the non-acidic chemical properties of nabumetone but also to its COX-1  COX-2 inhibitor profile .
Through its metabolite 6-MNA , nabumetone has a dose-related effect on platelet aggregation , but no effect on bleeding time in clinical studies .
Furthermore , several short-term studies have shown little to no effect on renal function .
Compared with COX-2 selective inhibitors , nabumetone exhibits similar anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in patients with arthritis and there is no evidence of excess GI or other forms of complications to date .
