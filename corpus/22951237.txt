The role of monoamine oxidase inhibitors in depression treatment guidelines .
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) have proven efficacy for treating depression and for decades have been a preferred treatment for patients with atypical depression , high levels of anxiety , anergic bipolar depression , and treatment-resistant depression .
However , MAOIs are infrequently used due to safety and tolerability concerns and the need for dietary restrictions .
Current guidelines , which are reviewed here , recommend MAOIs as third- , fourth- , or fifth-line treatments due to these concerns .
However , a transdermal formulation of selegiline limits the need for dietary restrictions and has fewer side effects than many more widely used antidepressants .
The availability of a safer and more tolerable formulation gives clinicians another option in their armamentarium for treating depression .
