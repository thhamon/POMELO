Can the pharmacokinetic characteristics of olmesartan medoxomil contribute to the improvement of blood pressure control ?
Poor compliance with treatment and early discontinuation negatively affect long-term blood pressure control .
According to the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention , Detection , Evaluation , and Treatment of High Blood Pressure , poor compliance could contribute to the lack of adequate blood pressure control in approximately 70% of patients with hypertension , even after treatment with several antihypertensive drugs .
This article discusses blood pressure control and patient compliance with antihypertensive drugs .
It then outlines the clinical pharmacokinetics and interaction profile of the novel antihypertensive olmesartan medoxomil , an angiotensin II receptor antagonist ( AIIRA ) , and relates the findings to the recommended dosing regimen and tolerability of the drug .
Many factors influence patient compliance , including forgetfulness , adverse effects , irregular lifestyle , and complexity of drug regimen , such as multiple drugs and , in particular , frequent dosing .
Drugs that are well tolerated and easy to manage in a once-daily regimen improve compliance .
In a study of different classes of antihypertensive drugs , patients taking AIIRAs were more likely to continue their treatment than those taking any other class of antihypertensive .
Therefore , the right drug choice may contribute to patient compliance .
The newest member of the AIIRAs , olmesartan medoxomil , is a long-acting antihypertensive drug with a favorable safety and tolerability profile .
It is not metabolized by and does not interfere with the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system .
These properties meet modern requirements for the treatment of hypertension .
