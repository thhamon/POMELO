The use of escitalopram beyond major depression depression: pharmacological aspects , efficacy and tolerability in anxiety disorders .
Escitalopram , the active ( S ) -enantiomer of citalopram , has been approved in many countries throughout the world for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders .
It is more potent and selective than citalopram in inhibiting serotonin re-uptake in the CNS , and less potent than various other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in relation to other transporter proteins and receptors: in particular , it is six times less potent than citalopram in binding to the histamine H1 and muscarinic receptors .
Escitalopram has favourable pharmacokinetics: it is rapidly absorbed , has a bioavailability of 80% and is not affected by food intake .
It has little potential for drug interactions interactions: it has low protein binding and , as it is metabolised by three CYP isozymes , any impairment in the activity of one is unlikely to have a significant effect on metabolic clearance .
Caution is necessary only when it is coadministered with drugs metabolised by CYP2D6 , such as metoprolol , or administered to the elderly or patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment .
The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of oral escitalopram are proportional at a range of doses including its therapeutic doses .
Escitalopram is approved for the treatment of a number of anxiety disorders .
It seems to be well tolerated and induces few or no discontinuation symptoms , and may be considered a first-line agent for the pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder , generalised anxiety disorder , panic disorder and social phobia .
Further studies are needed to define its activity in impulse control disorders .
