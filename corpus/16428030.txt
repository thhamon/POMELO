Safety of St St. .
John's Wort extract compared to synthetic antidepressants .
The clinical efficacy of some standardized St St. .
John's Wort extracts ( SWEs ) such as WS ( ( R ) ) 5570 , WS ( ( R ) ) 5572 or LI 160 in the treatment of mild , moderate and severe major depression has been demonstrated in 38 controlled clinical trials and two recent meta-analyses .
Sixteen post-marketing surveillance studies with such preparations , based on a total of 34 , 804 patients , recorded an incidence of adverse events ( AEs ) among patients between 0% and 6%. .
Of these studies , the four large-scale surveillance studies with a total of 14 , 245 patients recorded a rate of AEs ranging from 0.1% to 2.4% and a drop-out rate due to AEs of 0.1-0.9%. .
This is at least ten- ten-fold lower than that recorded with synthetic antidepressants .
AEs associated with SWE treatment were mild and transient in nearly all cases .
As with synthetic antidepressants , pharmacokinetic interactions may occur occasionally as a result of activity changes of drug-metabolising and drug-transporting proteins , especially CYP 3A4 and P-gp .
Risks to the patient are not caused by SWE but by drugs with a narrow therapeutic range .
Consequently , SWE preparations should not be taken concurrently with other antidepressants , with coumarin- coumarin-type anticoagulants , the immunosuppressants cyclosporine and tacrolimus , protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors used in anti-HIV treatment or with certain antineoplastic agents .
However , such cases are extremely rare and , with medical supervision , easily avoided .
In conclusion , the safety of SWE must be considered more favourable than that of synthetic antidepressants .
