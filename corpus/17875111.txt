Possible case of potentiation of the antiplatelet effect of cilostazol by grapefruit juice .
We present a case of purpura associated with concomitant ingestion of cilostazol , aspirin and grapefruit juice .
A 79-year-old man with atherosclerosis obliterans , taking cilostazol and aspirin , complained of purpura .
Interview by a pharmacist revealed that he had been taking grapefruit juice for a month .
His purpura disappeared upon cessation of grapefruit juice , although his medication was not altered .
The most probable cause of his purpura is an increase in the blood level of cilostazol because of the inhibition of cilostazol metabolism by components of grapefruit juice .
Aspirin may possibly have potentiated the risk of purpura .
Grapefruit juice should be avoided in patients taking cilostazol , especially in patients being concomitantly treated with other anticoagulants .
