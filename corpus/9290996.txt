Esophageal obstruction by solidification of the enteral feed feed: a complication to be prevented .
We report three cases of esophageal obstruction due to solidification of enteral feed refluxed from the stomach in patients being fed through a nasogastric tube .
All three patients were administered sucralfate continuously by tube .
The few previous descriptions of this rare complication have also implicated sucralfate with its pathogenesis .
Given its clinical importance and the growing use of long-term enteral nutrition , this adverse event needs to be considered .
